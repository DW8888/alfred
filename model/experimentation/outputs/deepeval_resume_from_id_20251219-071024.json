    "tone_score": 1.0,
    "tone_reason": "The resume is highly professional: clear sections, consistent formatting, and no grammar issues. It is strongly action-oriented with numerous active verbs and measurable outcomes (e.g., automated pipeline processing 1M+ records, 5\u00d7 faster feedback loops, ~5% accuracy improvement and ~8% toxicity reduction, 60% faster applications and 300% more weekly applications). Persona alignment is excellent for cloud/data/AI roles\u2014extensive AWS and ML tooling (Bedrock, SageMaker, Glue, Athena), relevant projects (Alfred agentic assistant), and appropriate seniority for solutions architect/data-science positions. The three criterion scores are consistent, producing a top combined rating based on the provided evaluation steps.",
    "alignment_score": 0.4,
    "alignment_reason": "Checklist created from the JD included responsibilities (1\u20139), minimum quals (10\u201313), and preferred quals (14\u201321). Strengths: the resume explicitly documents AWS architecture work, microservices, APIs/FastAPI, CI/CD, databases (Postgres/pgvector, DynamoDB), Python-based ML/LLM work (Bedrock, SageMaker), and concrete outcomes (automated pipeline processing 1M+ records, 5\u00d7 faster feedback loops; fine-tuning improving accuracy ~5% and reducing toxicity ~8%; Alfred project reducing time-to-apply 60% and increasing applications 300%). Those map to items like architecting scalable systems, building reusable back-end components, performance optimization, variety of technologies, and ownership of projects. Partial matches: cross-functional collaboration and system ownership are shown (vendor relations, presentations, project ownership) but mostly from internships/projects rather than sustained team leadership; maintainable/testable code and release practices are referenced (testing scripts, GitHub Actions) but not detailed as large-scale production engineering practices. Missing or weak: the critical minimum qualification of 6+ years programming experience (or equivalent senior track record) is not met; front-end/UI implementation (modern client-side frameworks or mobile UI work) and key preferred languages (C/C++, Java, Swift, Kotlin) are not present; evidence of setting long-term technical direction for a team and sustained high-reliability production ownership is limited. Penalizations: major omission for senior level experience and some company/title-specific responsibilities (lead technical efforts, long-term product ownership) reduces fit despite strong technical tool coverage and quant metrics. Given the mix of many explicit/partial matches on tools and measurable outcomes but a major mismatch on seniority and front-end/mobile language experience, the resume scores low-to-mid for this Meta Product Software Engineer role.",
    "impact_score": 0.9,
    "impact_reason": "The resume contains multiple bullets with clear action verbs plus numeric metrics and business outcomes: e.g., automated a sentiment pipeline processing 1M+ records with real-time QuickSight dashboards and \u201c5\u00d7 faster feedback loops\u201d; fine-tuned SageMaker models improving accuracy (~5%) and reducing toxicity (~8%); Alfred project reduced time-to-apply by 60% and increased weekly applications by 300%; 96% cohort graduation rate and 800+ devices refurbished are additional measurable results. These demonstrate explicit actions, numeric metrics, and business impact. Minor shortcomings: several bullets are descriptive or lack metrics (e.g., \u201cdesigned and presented\u2026 reference architectures,\u201d \u201cbuilt POCs\u201d without outcome), and a few use passive or non-quantified phrasing, which justifies a small penalty from a perfect score.",
    "credtail_score": 0.9,
    "credtail_reason": "Nearly all claims in the Actual Output are directly supported by the Retrieval Context: name, contact info, summary, employers (AWS, WOPLLI, Mayor\u2019s Office, RF CUNY & Generation USA), internship dates (Jun 2025\u2013Sep 2025; Jun 2024\u2013Sep 2024; Feb 2024\u2013May 2024; Feb 2022\u2013Aug 2023), degrees (MS expected Jan 2026 with GPA 4.0; BTech Jun 2024 with GPA 3.78 and honors), certifications, project \u201cAlfred\u201d and its tech (FastAPI, PostgreSQL+pgvector, OpenAI GPT-4.1 mini, Docker, CI/CD), and the listed core technologies and skills (Python libraries, AWS services including Bedrock and SageMaker, Glue, QuickSight, Azure items, databases, ML topics). No major fabrications were found. Only minor discrepancies are present (spelling/typographical differences in the Retrieval Context such as \u201cClusering Algorithms\u201d vs the Actual Output\u2019s \u201cClustering Algorithms\u201d and \u201cRefeerbished\u201d vs \u201cRefurbished\u201d), which warrant partial support for those specific tokens but do not change the factual alignment of the claims. Those small mismatches led to a one-point deduction from a perfect match."

    "alignment_reason": "Followed the checklist from the job posting: resume explicitly matches core programming/data skills (Python, SQL/relational DBs, AWS services like EC2/S3/Lambda/Glue/SageMaker, Git, Docker, CI/CD) and shows measurable outcomes (1M+ record pipeline, 5\u00d7 faster feedback loops, model accuracy +5%/toxicity -8%, 60% time reduction/300% applications). Several responsibilities/tools are only partial matches (microservices, scalable architectures, Linux instruction, internships covering scripting) but lack explicit systems-level experience required by Meta (OS-level software, compilers, network distribution, building high\u2011volume servers at platform scale), core web technologies (HTML/CSS/JavaScript), editor experience (VIM/Emacs), and explicit test-coverage or company/product-release practices.

Examples: Solutions Architect Intern at Amazon Web Services (Arlington, VA) Jun 2025\u2013Sep 2025 and Software Developer Intern at WOPLLI Jun 2024\u2013Sep 2024 are present with identical highlights; the Alfred project (FastAPI, PostgreSQL+pgvector, OpenAI GPT-4.1 mini), MS expected Jan 2026 and BS Jun 2024, and listed AWS services (Bedrock, SageMaker, Glue, QuickSight, etc.) all appear in the context. No claims in the Actual Output are missing or contradicted in the Retrieval Context (only minor typographical errors exist in the source data), so no fabrications or penalties were applied."
