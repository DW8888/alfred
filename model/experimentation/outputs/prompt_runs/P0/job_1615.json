  "reasoning": "Darwhin Gomez is a strong match for the Solutions Architect position at Insight Global based on several key factors. Firstly, he has a solid background in software engineering and architecture, with relevant experience as a Solutions Architect Intern at Amazon Web Services (AWS), where he designed secure, scalable AWS reference architectures and automated data pipelines. This aligns well with the job's requirement for expertise in custom application design and automation efforts. Additionally, his core competencies include significant experience with APIs, particularly REST and FastAPI, which is crucial for the role. Furthermore, his educational background in Data Science and Computer Information Systems, combined with certifications such as AWS Certified Solutions Architect, further solidifies his qualifications. However, it is important to note that while he has experience in Python and SQL, the job description specifically mentions .NET expertise, which is not explicitly highlighted in his profile. Overall, Darwhin's skills and experiences make him a high match for the Solutions Architect role, particularly in automation and cloud architecture.",
