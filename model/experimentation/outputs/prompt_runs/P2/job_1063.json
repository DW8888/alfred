  "job_id": 1063,
  "variant": "P2",
  "reasoning": "The resume has been aligned with the job description for the Senior Software Engineer position at Eliassen Group. Key skills and experiences such as proficiency in React, Node.js, OAuth, and Azure cloud services were not present in the original profile. The experience at WOPLLI Technologies involved configuring Azure environments, which partially supports the requirement for Azure familiarity. The experience as a Software Developer Intern and the IT Instructor Assistant roles demonstrate relevant software development and teaching skills, but specific technologies like React and Highcharts were not mentioned in the profile. Therefore, the resume reflects only the supported claims and relevant experiences, omitting unsupported technologies and skills.",
