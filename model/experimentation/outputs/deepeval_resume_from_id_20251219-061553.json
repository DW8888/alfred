There is no significant imbalance between criteria, and the action-oriented examples and persona evidence consistently support the professional presentation.

Weighted sum \u224844% \u2192 base \u22484/10. Applied specificity penalty (-2) because the resume is generic and does not reference Robert Half, the Sr. title, or Brooklyn tailoring. Added small concrete-evidence bonus (+2) for named tools and measurable results. Final score reflects matched items (Linux, quantified outcomes, cloud/AWS), partially matched responsibilities (Linux but not SME/embedded), missing items (embedded engineering, C++, .NET, explicit company/title tailoring) and the penalty for lack of tailoring.",

Shortcomings: several bullets remain unquantified or high-level (e.g., cloud configuration, architecture design) and some phrasing is somewhat generic/passive, which reduces overall clarity on ROI and scalability.
