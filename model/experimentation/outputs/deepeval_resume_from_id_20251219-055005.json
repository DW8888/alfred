That omission is a major disqualifier given the JD explicitly lists it as mandatory.

    "impact_reason": "Strong use of active, action-oriented language (e.g., \u201cDelivered,\u201d \u201cDeveloped,\u201d \u201cCollaborated,\u201d \u201cManaged\u201d) and inclusion of concrete metrics \u2014 36 lessons to over 200 learners with a 96% cohort graduation rate \u2014 which earns credit for measurable results and clear educational outcome. However, several bullets are vague or lack measurable/business impact (e.g., \u201cDeveloped comprehensive testing materials,\u201d \u201cProvide white glove service,\u201d \u201cParticipate in projects,\u201d and internship duties without %/time/cost/quality metrics), reducing clarity on broader business outcomes and making some accomplishments generic. Overall a solid, metric-backed resume with limited scope of quantified impact beyond the teaching role, so points are deducted for insufficient metrics and occasional vagueness.",
    "credtail_score": 0.4,
    "credtail_reason": "Verified items: personal contact info (name, email, phone, location), LinkedIn/GitHub URLs, IT Instructor Assistant (RF CUNY & Generation USA) with 36 lessons and 96% graduation rate, Software Developer Intern (WOPLLI Technologies) Jun 2024\u2013Sep 2024, Bachelor (CUNY NYC College of Technology) Jun 2024 with GPA 3.78 and honors, Master\u2019s expected Jan 2026 with GPA 4.0 and Dean\u2019s List, and several certifications (AWS Solutions Architect, Google Cybersecurity, Google Information Support). Missing/omitted from Actual Output: extensive technical core skills listed in the Retrieval Context (Python libraries, SQL/NoSQL, detailed AWS services including Bedrock/SageMaker/Glue, FastAPI, PostgreSQL+pgvector, Docker, CI/CD, data-engineering/ML tooling), the Solutions Architect Intern role at Amazon Web Services (Jun 2025\u2013Sep 2025) and the Alfred project (FastAPI, pgvector, OpenAI), and the AWS Certified AI Practitioner cert which appears in retrieval but is absent. Fabrications/inconsistencies: the Actual summary shifts to patient care/nursing (not in retrieval), the Mayor\u2019s Office entry is labeled as a volunteer and shown as \u201cFeb 2024 \u2013 Current\u201d whereas retrieval shows \u201cIT Support Intern\u201d from Feb 2024\u2013May 2024 (date/title contradiction). Penalties applied: major penalty for omission of core technical stack (highest priority), penalty for omitting AWS internship and project evidence, and penalties for the fabricated summary and date/title contradiction. These lead to a reduced credibility score."
