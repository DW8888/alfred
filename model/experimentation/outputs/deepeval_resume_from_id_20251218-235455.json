    "alignment_score": 0.2,
    "alignment_reason": "Resume demonstrates relevant cloud and data skills: explicit AWS experience (EC2, S3, Lambda, Glue, Bedrock, SageMaker, Macie), NoSQL/DynamoDB and relational DBs (Oracle listed), REST APIs, microservices, SDLC, and a quantified project (automated sentiment pipeline processing 1M+ records with ~5% accuracy improvement and ~8% toxicity reduction). However it fails to meet core Principal/IC4 requirements: experience is internship-level (no 10+ years) and shows no senior/technical leadership or system-architect ownership; key languages from the JD (Java, GoLang, C#) are missing (resume emphasizes Python); networking protocols and mission-critical operational experience (TCP/IP, HTTP, tier-one livesite) are not explicitly shown; frontend/UX stack and tools (HTML/CSS/TypeScript, React/Vue/Angular, Figma) are omitted; distributed persistence/storage and deep performance-tuning at cloud-scale are not evidenced beyond POC work. Coverage is therefore poor and not tailored to a Principal PMTS role.",

    "punctuality_reason": "The score is 0.92 because the actual output mostly aligns with the retrieval context but contains a few specific contradictions: it treats the phone number as a single value despite the context listing two different numbers (347-491-2955 vs 929-305-7353), it gives the Master\u2019s expected graduation as Dec 2025 while the structured profile shows Jan 2026, and it asserts a 3.78 GPA even though an artifacts resume fragment lists 3.8.",
    "tone_score": 0.8,
    "tone_reason": "Professionalism is strong due to clear headings, contact info, consistent sections, and generally good grammar and formatting (education, skills, projects, experience are well organized). Action-oriented strength is evident: frequent strong verbs (Developed, Implemented, Created, Deployed) and measurable results (65,000+ records, 400 devices, 200+ learners, 36 lessons) that clarify responsibility and impact. Persona alignment is moderate: the resume lists core data-science skills and an ongoing Data Science & ML master\u2019s, but projects are skewed toward web/database and IT support rather than ML modeling or results-driven data science work, so the match to an ML-focused role is limited. With those component assessments, the output ranks well on professionalism and action orientation but shows room to improve persona fit by adding ML-specific projects, metrics on modeling outcomes, or relevant coursework/capstone details.",

Responsibilities \u2014 business analysis leadership, cross-departmental influence, and producing persuasive insight decks are missing; resume shows only internship/teaching roles (IT Support Intern, Instructor Assistant) and student projects, so senior-level ownership and 5+ years\u2019 experience requirement are not met. Database work is partially matched by project ERD/SQL scripts and a POS/stock-report project (65k records), but these are academic/projects rather than production business databases. Outcomes/impact \u2014 almost no quantified business results or closed-loop project deliveries tied to business metrics; only generic statements about monitoring and student progress tracking. Overall: clear strengths in core technical skills and database/project exposure, but major gaps in experience level, BI/Excel tooling, leadership/impact, and measurable business outcomes required by the role.",
    "impact_score": 0.8,
    "impact_reason": "Strong presence of multiple clear metrics (e.g., 65,000+ records, support for over 400 devices, 36 lessons to 200+ learners, GPA 3.78, specific dates), satisfying the requirement for measurable outcomes (Step 1). However, many statements describe activities rather than direct business impact (no quantified revenue, cost, conversion, retention, or efficiency improvements), reducing clarity of business outcome (Step 2). Language is mostly active but includes some vague/passive phrasing like \u201cassisted\u201d and outcome-lite bullets, so minor penalty (Step 3). Overall multiple explicit metrics but limited linkage to business impact, so a high-but-not-top score is appropriate.",

Scoring: 23 of 29 atomic claims verified \u2192 base score \u2248 7.9/10. Applied penalties: heavy penalty for two fabricated projects (\u22122), smaller penalties for the mismatched master\u2019s date and missing OS/language/DB phrasing (\u22121.0 total), and a minor consistency reduction for the graduation-date discrepancy (\u22120.5). Final rounded score: 5. The score reflects strong alignment on education (bachelor), contact, core data/infra skills, and the two listed internships, but recent projects and several specific skill phrasings/dates are unsupported or mismatched in the retrieval context."

Business impact is moderately clear\u2014device restoration and high graduation rate imply efficiency and training effectiveness\u2014but it lacks direct financial or conversion metrics (step 2). Language includes several weak/passive phrases (\"provide support,\" \"assist,\" \"participate\"), which reduces clarity and results orientation and warrants a penalty (step 3). Overall strong on measurable counts and relevance but held back by passive wording and limited explicit business-impact framing, and thus scores in the upper-mid range (step 4).",
    "credtail_score": 0.3,
    "credtail_reason": "Verified items (from Retrieval Context): education entry and institution, GPA 3.8 and Expected Graduation May 2024 (artifact lines), RF CUNY / Generation USA IT Instructor Assistant role and Feb 2022\u2013Aug 2023 dates, Mayor\u2019s Office of Information Services as an employer, contact details (email, LinkedIn URL, 929-305-7353 phone present in artifacts), core skills clearly present (Python, SQL/MySQL, AWS, Power BI, REST, Git, Java noted in artifacts/summary), and certifications (AWS Solutions Architect \u2013 Associate, Google Cybersecurity, Google Information Support). Unverified / mismatched / fabricated items: Mayor\u2019s Office employment dates are mismatched (Actual lists 02/2024\u2013Current vs Retrieval shows Feb 2024\u2013May 2024), device refurbishment counts differ (Actual: \u201cover 400\u201d vs Retrieval: \u201cover 800\u201d), project entries (Financial Stocks Report, EzRental) are not present in the Retrieval Context, and several listed technologies in Actual (JavaScript, HTML, XML, PHP, SOAP, Visual Studio, Microsoft Office, explicit \u201cC#\u201d) are not found verbatim in the Retrieval Context. Scoring logic: base ratio of verified to claimed items (~23 verified of ~33 claimed \u2192 ~7/10) was reduced for major fabrications/mismatches (heavy penalty for the Mayor\u2019s Office date conflict and conflicting device counts) and further reduced for missing but plausible items (absent projects and multiple unverified technologies) and internal inconsistency between \u201cCurrent\u201d employment vs Retrieval end date. These penalties produced the final credibility assessment."
