19,1610,P3,9.75609756097561,10,7,36.75609756097561,"Punctuality: The score is 0.98 because the only contradiction is a minor numeric mismatch: the retrieval context contains 'Dean's List (5x)' while an artifact line lists 'Dean's List (8x)'; the actual output appears to report 5x contrary to the artifact (context suggests 8x), so verify the correct count.
Tone: All three evaluation categories scored 5/5: Professionalism (clear, well-formatted, formal resume language), Action-Oriented (strong verbs and quantified outcomes such as “processed over 1M records,” “5× faster feedback-to-action,” “5% increase” and “8% reduction”), and Persona Alignment (strong match to a cloud/AI Solutions Architect with relevant tools, certifications, and projects). Average = 5.0, mapped to the 0–10 scale for an overall score of ten, with no individual score differing from the average by ≥2.
Alignment: Per the job context (Cloud Solutions Architect at Outlier AI emphasizing AI intelligence/safety and high-quality LLM data), the resume strongly matches technical responsibilities and outcomes: explicit cloud architecture and automated data pipeline work, Generative AI/model fine-tuning, and explicit AI-safety improvements. Tools/technologies are an exact match for AWS-focused infrastructure (Bedrock, SageMaker, Glue, Athena, Lambda, QuickSight, S3, etc.) plus CI/CD, Docker, PostgreSQL/pgvector and LLM integrations. Measurable outcomes are well-quantified (processed >1M records, 5× faster feedback-to-action, +5% accuracy, −8% toxicity, 96% cohort grad rate). Missing/weak: no company- or title-specific customization (no mention of Outlier or Scale AI or tailoring language) and a bit of generic summary phrasing. Weighted match (responsibilities ~90%, tools ~95%, outcomes ~95%, customization 0%) gives ~8.3/10, reduced for lack of customization and slight generic wording, resulting in the final score.
Impact: I evaluated 16 action bullets. Three bullets met all three criteria (Built/deployed pipeline processing over 1M records with 5× faster feedback-to-action; Fine-tuned models with +5% accuracy and -8% toxicity; Achieved 96% cohort graduation). Several bullets contained clear metrics but had unclear business outcomes (e.g., 36 lessons for 200+ learners), while many others had actions but no measurable results or used vague language (e.g., “Designed and presented…”, “Automated troubleshooting… reducing manual workload”, “ensuring robust…”). I applied the rubric and penalties for lack of measurable results or vague descriptors, averaged the penalized sub-scores across all bullets (16), and rounded to produce the final score.
CredTail: High verbatim alignment for core items: degrees (Master of Science – Data Science and Machine Learning, GPA 4.0, Expected Jan 2026; Bachelor of Technology – Computer Information Systems, GPA 3.78, Jun 2024), employers and dates (Solutions Architect Intern, Amazon Web Services — Jun 2025–Sep 2025; Software Developer Intern, WOPLLI — Jun 2024–Sep 2024; IT Support Intern, Mayor’s Office of Information Services — Feb 2024–May 2024; IT Instructor Assistant, RF CUNY & Generation USA — Feb 2022–Aug 2023) and many technologies/projects (AWS services: EC2, S3, Lambda, RDS, DynamoDB, Glue, QuickSight, Bedrock, Macie, SageMaker; Alfred project: FastAPI, PostgreSQL+pgvector, OpenAI GPT-4.1 mini, Docker) appear verbatim in the Retrieval Context and support a high-fidelity match. Discrepancies that reduced credibility: Actual output lists Tableau (Visualization: Power BI, Tableau) which is not present in the Retrieval Context (penalty applied for a fabricated/contradicted technology), and the Actual omits several plausible Retrieval items (Google Information Support Certificate; R Programming; explicit “Integrated Google Generative AI” from the Alfred project) — each counted as missing supporting details. These issues (one contradicted/fabricated item and multiple missing but plausible details) justify a moderate penalty from a perfect match.",47,2025-12-18 18:30:19.24264,6,4
24,1089,P2,10,10,2,37,"Punctuality: The score is 1.00 because the contradictions list is empty, indicating no inconsistencies between the actual output and the retrieval context — the output is fully faithful. Well done.
Tone: Highly professional formatting and grammar with clear sections (Summary, Core Skills, Experience, Education). Strong action-orientation: bullets start with verbs (Designed, Built, Automated, Fine-tuned, Developed, Delivered, Maintained) and include measurable results (processed 1M+ records, 5× faster feedback loops, ~5% accuracy gain, 96% cohort graduation). Excellent persona alignment for cloud/data/ML roles (AWS services, Bedrock LLMs, SageMaker, ETL, data pipelines, Solutions Architect internship). Minor nit: small terminology inconsistency ('Postgre' instead of PostgreSQL), but this does not materially detract from overall fit.
Alignment: Top-priority Android/Java skills and mobile-specific experience are missing: no Android SDK, Java, mobile memory management, multithreading, or shipped mobile product supporting millions (preferred items 13–16). The resume does show exact matches for education (Bachelor’s) and partial matches for system architecture and performance work via AWS solutions and a 1M+ record pipeline and accuracy/toxicity metrics, but those reflect cloud/ML focus (Python, SageMaker, Glue) not Android app development or leadership/8+ years experience. Because key role-specific tools, platform experience, and senior qualifications are largely absent and language is not tailored to the Android/Meta role, the output scores very low on alignment.
Impact: I scored the resume a 5 because the evaluation found a mixed set of bullets: strong, measurable accomplishments (Automated sentiment pipeline processing 1M+ records with 5× faster feedback; SageMaker fine-tuning improving accuracy ~5% and reducing toxicity ~8%; maintaining a 96% graduation rate; delivering 36 lessons to 200+ learners) scored highest and drove the rating up. Several bullets show clear action but lack measurable outcomes (designed AWS reference architectures; built POCs for Bedrock+Athena/Glue/Lambda; designed a Virtual Credential System; developed Postman scripts; automated troubleshooting) and were penalized for vague/non-actionable phrasing. One bullet (supported VIP users) lacked impact metrics and was weakest. Following the steps, I gave high marks to bullets with explicit action+metrics, deducted points for missing/ambiguous metrics and non-actionable language (−2 per vague bullet), averaged the per-bullet scores (≈5.1) and normalized to the final integer score reported. The strongest drivers: the 1M+ records/5×, ~5%/~8%, and 96% metrics; the weakest drivers were the numerous unspecified-impact bullets lacking metrics or business outcomes.
CredTail: Ground truth extracted from Retrieval Context — Degrees: MS in Data Science & Machine Learning (City University of New York – School of Professional Studies, Expected Jan 2026, GPA 4.0, Dean’s List 2x); B.Tech in Computer Information Systems (City University of New York – NYC College of Technology, Jun 2024, GPA 3.78, Dean’s List 5x, National Honor Society).

Core technologies (selected): Python (pandas, scikit‑learn, seaborn, PyTorch); SQL/NoSQL; AWS (EC2, S3, Lambda, RDS, DynamoDB, Glue, QuickSight, Bedrock, Macie, SageMaker); Azure (App Service, Functions, Storage); ETL/ELT (Glue, SSIS); APIs (REST, FastAPI, Postman, Swagger); Docker; Git; Postgre/Oracle/MySQL/MongoDB/DynamoDB; Algorithms & Data Structures. Comparison: every degree, institution, employer, employment date, certification, and the core technologies explicitly claimed in the Actual Output are present in the Retrieval Context as exact matches (no partial date mismatches, no items claimed in the output that are absent or contradicted by the context). No Missing (claimed-but-absent) or Fabricated (contradicted) items to penalize.

Tone: Professionalism: 5 — clean, polished formatting with clear headings, contact links, and well-organized sections. Action-Oriented: 5 — uses strong verbs and multiple quantified results (1M+ records, 5x faster, 5% accuracy gain, 60% time reduction, 300% application increase). Persona Alignment: 5 — content, skills (AWS, SageMaker, Bedrock, ML), and project focus closely match a cloud/AI solutions architect/data-science persona. Average = 5.0 (no individual score differs from the average by ≥2). Overall mapping to the requested 0–10 scale yields the top score.
Alignment: Extracted requirements: cloud architecture for AI, improving LLM intelligence & safety, high-quality data for LLMs, remote/Outlier (Scale AI) context. Comparison: Exact matches — strong AWS cloud architecture and services (EC2, S3, Lambda, SageMaker, Bedrock), model fine-tuning experience with measured improvements (accuracy +5%, toxicity -8%), large-scale data pipeline (1M+ records, 5x faster), generative AI certification. Partial matches — LLM dataset curation/labeling and formal model-safety processes are only implied (toxicity metric is relevant but limited). Absent — no company/title-specific customization (no mention of Outlier or Scale AI) and no explicit data-labeling/quality workflows or LLM-evaluation frameworks. Weighted calculation (responsibilities 40% ≈80% match; tools 30% ≈90%; measurable outcomes 20% ≈85%; customization 10% =0%) → weighted match ≈76% → maps to ~7.6/10 (rounded to 8). Applied a one-point penalty for missing company-specific tailoring and minor generic phrasing, yielding the reported integer score. The resume is technically strong for the role but lacks explicit Outlier/Scale AI tailoring and documented dataset-quality processes.
Impact: I evaluated 23 bulleted items. Four bullets meet all three criteria (action + specific metric + explicit business outcome): the sentiment pipeline (1M+ records, 5x faster), SageMaker fine-tuning (accuracy +5%, toxicity -8%), IT instructor (36 lessons, 200+ learners, 96% graduation), and Alfred project (application time -60%, weekly applications +300%). Most bullets (19) lack measurable results and therefore received the -2 penalty for no metric; several experience bullets also used vague descriptors (e.g., “enhancing scalability and security,” “ensuring compliance and efficiency,” “significantly,” “enhancing system integrity and availability”) and incurred the -1 vagueness penalty. I assigned provisional scores per the rubric (9–10 for clear action+metric+outcome, lower for partial items), applied the penalties described, averaged across all bullets, and rounded to produce the final mapped score.
CredTail: Verified exact matches in the Retrieval Context for degrees, employers, dates, and many core technologies: Master of Science – Data Science and Machine Learning (Expected Jan 2026); Bachelor of Technology – Computer Information Systems (Jun 2024, GPA 3.78, Dean’s List (5x), National Honor Society); Employers and dates: Amazon Web Services (AWS) — Jun 2025 – Sep 2025; WOPLLI Technologies — Jun 2024 – Sep 2024; Mayor’s Office of Information Services — Feb 2024 – May 2024; RF CUNY & Generation USA (Choose-U) — Feb 2022 – Aug 2023. Core technologies verified verbatim in the Retrieval Context include AWS (EC2, S3, Lambda, RDS, DynamoDB, Glue, QuickSight, Bedrock, SageMaker), FastAPI, and OpenAI GPT-4.1 (mini). Discrepancies (penalties applied): 1) Certification field: “Google Information Support Certificate” appears in Retrieval Context but is missing from the Actual Output (missing supporting detail, −1). 2) Cloud technology: “Macie” is present in Retrieval Context’s AWS list but omitted in the Actual Output cloud list (missing supporting detail, −1). 3) Project tech detail: Retrieval Context lists “PostgreSQL + pgvector” for Alfred but that technology is not mentioned in the Actual Output project entry (missing supporting detail, −1). No clear fabrications or direct contradictions were found. Starting from near-complete alignment, the three missing but plausible supporting details produced a total penalty of 3 points, yielding the final credibility score.",49,2025-12-18 18:33:20.933997,2,6

Tone: Professionalism: 5/5 — clean, consistent formatting, formal tone, working contact links and clear sectioning. Action‑Oriented: 5/5 — uses strong verbs and many quantified results (1M+ records, 5× faster feedback loops, ~5% accuracy gain, ~8% toxicity reduction, 36 lessons, 200+ learners, 96% graduation). Persona Alignment: 5/5 — tightly matches a cloud/ML/solutions‑architect persona (AWS services, Bedrock, SageMaker, RAG, FastAPI, CI/CD, Docker). Average = (5+5+5)/3 = 5.0 → scaled to a 10/10 overall. No individual score differs from the average by ≥2; only minor nitpick is a small potential timeline ambiguity between an expected MS in Jan 2026 and internship dates, but it does not undermine alignment.
Alignment: Extracted requirements: cloud/solutions architecture for AI, LLM integration and safety/data-quality focus, cloud/ML tooling, and company-specific tailoring to Outlier AI. Matches — Responsibilities (Exact): resume shows secure, scalable AWS architecture design, LLM POCs (Bedrock), pipelines, model fine-tuning and safety improvements. Tools/Technologies (Exact): strong AWS stack (Bedrock, SageMaker, Glue, Lambda, Athena, QuickSight), Docker, pgvector, PyTorch, etc. Measurable outcomes (Exact): quantified results (1M+ records processed, 5× faster feedback loops, ~+5% accuracy, −8% toxicity). Customization/Tailoring (Partial/Absent): no mention of Outlier AI or Scale AI and no explicit “Cloud Solutions Architect” target — only an intern title; lack of company-specific tailoring incurred a penalty. Weighted match yields ~95% before penalties; after a penalty for missing company-specific customization, final score is 8.
Impact: Only 4 of 15 bullets clearly include an action + specific metric + explicit business outcome (the sentiment pipeline processing 1M+ records with 5× faster feedback loops; SageMaker fine-tuning with ~5% accuracy gain and ~8% toxicity reduction; 36 lessons for 200+ learners; 96% cohort graduation rate). The majority (11/15) use action verbs but lack measurable metrics or clear outcomes (e.g., “Designed and presented secure, scalable AWS architectures,” “Built POCs… to deliver actionable sentiment insights,” project bullets about RAG/CI‑CD), so I applied the instructed penalties: -2 for missing measurable results and -1 for vague descriptors like “secure/scalable” or “actionable.” I assigned provisional sub-scores per bullet using the rubric, applied penalties, averaged the adjusted scores across all bullets, and mapped the average to the 1–10 scale to produce the final score.

Tone: Professionalism: 5 — polished, well-formatted resume with formal language and clear sections (contact, summary, certs, education, experience, projects, skills). Action-Oriented: 5 — strong verbs and quantified results throughout (e.g., processing over 1M feedback records, 5× faster feedback-to-action, 5% accuracy gain, 8% reduction in toxicity, 96% cohort graduation). Persona Alignment: 5 — tone, skills, and accomplishments align tightly with a Solutions Architect / Data & ML / Generative AI persona (AWS services, Bedrock, SageMaker, RAG project ‘Alfred’, relevant internships and certifications). Average = 5.0; no individual score differs from the average by ≥2.
Alignment: Step 1 extracted key requirements: cloud solutions architecture, building scalable/secure data pipelines for AI, improving AI intelligence/safety and data quality for LLMs, collaboration in a global/remote setting, and familiarity with cloud/ML tooling. Step 2 comparison: Responsibilities — Exact match (resume shows AWS architecture design, serverless/data pipelines, Generative AI tooling and AI-safety focus). Tools/Technologies — Exact match (explicit AWS services: Bedrock, SageMaker, Glue, Athena, Lambda, QuickSight; RAG, OpenAI embeddings, Docker, CI/CD). Measurable outcomes — Exact match (quantified achievements: pipeline processing >1M records, 5× faster feedback-to-action, +5% accuracy, −8% toxicity, 96% cohort graduation). Customization/tailoring — Partial/Absent (resume aligns with AI-safety mission but contains no explicit Outlier AI or Scale AI/company-specific language). Step 3 weighted match: responsibilities ~90%, tools ~90%, measurable outcomes ~90%, customization ~50% → weighted average ~86% → ~8.6/10. Step 4 penalties: minus one point for lack of company/title-specific customization and slight generic phrasing in summary. Final score reflects strong tool and outcome alignment but missing explicit Outlier/Scale AI tailoring.
Impact: I evaluated 15 bullets. Four bullets met all three criteria (action + specific metric + clear business outcome): the sentiment pipeline (processing >1M records and enabling 5× faster feedback-to-action), model fine-tuning (5% accuracy increase, 8% reduction in toxicity/hallucinations), lesson delivery (36 lessons for 200+ learners), and the 96% cohort graduation result. Most other bullets contained clear actions but no measurable metrics or only vague outcomes (e.g., “designed…tailored to enterprise client needs,” “configured and tested Azure environments,” “automated troubleshooting…reducing manual workload” without numeric impact). I assigned provisional sub-scores per bullet using the rubric, applied penalties (-2 for missing measurable results, -1 for vague descriptors), averaged the adjusted sub-scores (total 75 across 15 bullets → average 5.0), and mapped that to the final score. Strengths: several high-quality, metric-backed bullets. Shortcomings: majority of bullets lack quantification or explicit business impact, triggering penalties and lowering the overall average.

Tone: Professionalism 5/5 — clean, well‑structured resume with clear headers, contact links, certifications, education, and consistent formatting (minor terse bullet at WOPLLI). Action‑Oriented 5/5 — strong verbs and quantified outcomes throughout (e.g., processing 1M+ records, 5x faster feedback, +5% accuracy / -8% toxicity, 60% time reduction, 300% increase in weekly applications, 36 lessons to 200+ learners with 96% graduation). Persona Alignment 5/5 — content and tone strongly match a cloud/AI/data practitioner (AWS/GCP certs, SageMaker fine‑tuning, FastAPI + GPT‑4.1 project, explicit cloud/tool lists). Average = 5.0; no individual score differs from the average by ≥2. Overall score reflects excellent alignment with the evaluation criteria.
Alignment: Extracted requirements: cloud solutions architecture with AWS/SageMaker/ML tooling; generative LLM experience and model safety/data-quality focus; remote work and company-specific tailoring to Outlier AI/Scale AI. Comparison: Responsibilities — Exact match (AWS Solutions Architect cert, Solutions Architect role, designed AWS architectures, model fine-tuning experience). Tools/Technologies — Exact match (AWS services listed, SageMaker fine-tuning, OpenAI GPT-4.1, Docker, CI/CD, Azure). Measurable outcomes — Exact match (multiple quantified impacts: 5% accuracy gain, 8% toxicity reduction, 5x faster pipeline, 60% time reduction on project). Customization/tailoring — Absent (no mention of Outlier AI, Scale AI, data-labeling or explicit AI-safety/data-quality processes beyond isolated toxicity metric). Weighted match (40% responsibilities, 30% tools, 20% outcomes, 10% customization) gives ~81% -> ~8/10; applying a penalty for missing company/title-specific customization reduces to a final score of 7. Strengths: strong cloud/ML tooling and quantified results. Shortcomings: no Outlier-specific tailoring and limited explicit data-quality/safety process description.
Impact: I counted 22 bullets. Four bullets met all three criteria (action + specific metrics + clear business outcome): the sentiment pipeline (1M+ records, 5x faster), model fine-tuning (accuracy +5%, toxicity -8%), instructor stats (36 lessons, 200+, 96% grad rate), and project outcomes (60% time reduction, 300% more applications). I assigned high provisional scores to those (9–10). Most other bullets (18/22) lacked numeric metrics or were passive/listings (certifications, skills, languages, communities, and items like “Designed AWS architectures” and “Configured Azure environments”), so I gave low provisional scores and applied penalties: -2 for no measurable result or passive phrasing and -1 for vague descriptors such as “enhancing,” “optimal,” or “significantly.” After averaging the penalized sub-scores across all bullets (sum 59/22 ≈ 2.68) and rounding, the final score is three, reflecting strong specific results in a few bullets but widespread lack of measurable outcomes elsewhere.

Persona Alignment 5/5 — skills, tools, and tone strongly match a solutions-architect/data-science role (AWS, Bedrock, SageMaker, ETL, SQL, ML). Average = 5.0; no individual score differs from the average by ≥2. Mapped to a 0–10 scale, this yields the highest alignment score.
Alignment: Extracted requirements: cloud/AI architecture design, scalable data pipelines for LLMs, model safety/guardrails, and collaboration (company focus: Outlier AI/Scale AI improving LLM intelligence & safety). Required tools: AWS stack (Bedrock, SageMaker, Glue, Lambda, Athena, QuickSight, S3, RDS, DynamoDB), generative AI/LLMs, security. Desired outcomes: measurable model quality/safety improvements and faster feedback loops. Comparison: Responsibilities = Exact (resume shows AWS architectures, automated pipelines, agentic AI tooling, guardrails). Tools/Technologies = Exact (lists Bedrock, SageMaker, Glue, Lambda, Athena, QuickSight, DynamoDB, S3, etc.). Measurable Outcomes = Exact (1M+ records processed, 5× faster feedback loops, ~5% accuracy improvement, ~8% toxicity reduction; project metrics also present). Customization/Tailoring = Absent (no mention of Outlier or Scale AI or job-title-specific language). Scoring: weighted match = 0.4*1 + 0.3*1 + 0.2*1 + 0.1*0 = 0.9 → base 9/10. Penalty: subtract 1 point for lack of company/title-specific customization (resume otherwise specific and quantified). Final score justification: strong alignment on responsibilities, tools, and measurable outcomes; missing company-specific tailoring. 
Impact: I followed the steps: 30 bullets were checked. Seven bullets clearly contained an action verb, specific measurable metric, and an explicit business outcome (examples: the automated sentiment pipeline processing 1M+ records with 5× faster feedback loops; SageMaker fine-tuning with ~5% accuracy / ~8% toxicity changes; refurbishing 800+ devices; 100+ tickets with service reviews; 36 lessons for 200+ learners; maintaining a 96% graduation rate; Alfred reducing time-to-apply by 60% and boosting applications by 300%). The other 23 bullets lacked measurable metrics and therefore triggered the -2 penalties; additionally I applied -1 penalties for vague descriptors in a few bullets (e.g., “excellent” reviews, “enhance” security posture, “enhanced” content creation, and an unquantified reduction of manual workload). Provisional sub-scores were assigned per the rubric, penalties applied, and the mean of the adjusted sub-scores was computed and mapped/rounded to the 1–10 scale to yield the final score.

Minor shortcoming: a few high-impact metrics could use brief contextual sourcing or timeframe for extra credibility.
Alignment: Job extraction: Cloud Solutions Architect (Remote) at Outlier AI / Scale AI — key needs: cloud architecture and systems design for ML/LLM workflows, data pipelines and data-quality for LLM training, model safety/guardrails, experience with LLM infra and cloud tools, remote collaboration. Comparison: Responsibilities — Exact match: resume explicitly shows AWS architecture design, automated data pipelines, Generative AI/LLM work, model fine-tuning and safety/guardrails (explicitly cites toxicity/hallucination reduction). Tools/technologies — Exact match: strong, specific AWS stack (EC2, S3, Lambda, Glue, Athena, QuickSight, Bedrock, SageMaker), plus OpenAI embeddings, pgvector, Docker, CI/CD. Measurable outcomes — Exact match: multiple quantified impacts (processed >1M records; 5× faster feedback-to-action; 5% accuracy gain; 8% toxicity reduction; 60% time reduction; 300% more applications). Customization/tailoring — Absent: no mention of Outlier AI or Scale/role-specific tailoring; limited explicit reference to data-labeling or high-quality training-data workflows that Outlier emphasizes (only implied via pipelines/RAG). Scoring logic: responsibilities weighted 40% (~90% match), tools 30% (~95%), measurable outcomes 20% (100%), customization 10% (0%); weighted average computed accordingly. Penalty applied for missing company-specific customization (subtracting points). Final assessment: strong technical and outcome alignment with notable missing company/role tailoring and limited explicit mention of data-quality/labeling workflows.
Impact: I evaluated 17 bullets. Four bullets met all three criteria (action + metric + explicit business outcome): the AWS sentiment pipeline (processed >1M records, 5× faster feedback-to-action), AWS model fine-tuning (5% accuracy gain, 8% toxicity/hallucination reduction), the RF CUNY result (96% cohort graduation rate), and the Alfred project outcomes (60% time reduction, 300% more completed applications). Many bullets lacked specific metrics or clear business outcomes (e.g., “Designed and presented secure, scalable AWS architectures,” WOPLLI and many Mayor’s Office bullets), and several used no measurable results (penalized per instructions). Provisional sub-scores were assigned per bullet, -2 penalties applied for missing measurable results, then averaged across all bullets and rounded to produce the final score. The resume shows some strong, quantifiable achievements but is inconsistent—most bullets need clearer metrics and explicit business impact.
CredTail: High verbatim alignment: degrees (Master of Science – Data Science and Machine Learning, GPA 4.0, Expected Jan 2026; Bachelor of Technology – Computer Information Systems, GPA 3.78, Jun 2024) appear in the Retrieval Context; employers and dates match verbatim (Solutions Architect Intern, Amazon Web Services (AWS) — Jun 2025–Sep 2025; Software Developer Intern, WOPLLI — Jun 2024–Sep 2024; IT Support Intern, Mayor’s Office of Information Services — Feb 2024–May 2024; IT Instructor Assistant, RF CUNY & Generation USA — Feb 2022–Aug 2023); core technologies and project tech are verbatim in the Retrieval Context (AWS services: Bedrock, SageMaker, Athena, Glue, QuickSight; FastAPI; PostgreSQL + pgvector; OpenAI GPT-4.1 mini; Docker; CI/CD). Discrepancies: one plausible supporting item present in Retrieval Context but omitted from the Actual Output — the ""Google Information Support Certificate"" (penalty applied: -1). No clear fabrications or contradicted items found.

Tone: Very strong professional resume: clear, consistent formatting and formal language with minimal errors; demonstrates action-oriented writing through abundant verbs (Designed, Built, Automated, Fine-tuned, Developed) and quantified outcomes (1M+ records, 5× faster feedback loops, ~5% accuracy gain, 60% time reduction, 300% application increase). Persona alignment is excellent for solutions-architect/ML roles, citing relevant tech (AWS Bedrock/SageMaker/Glue/Athena, QuickSight, RAG, pgvector) and a relevant project (Alfred). Minor nit: small terminology/typo (""Postgre"") and occasional abbreviation density, but these do not undermine overall quality.
Alignment: The resume is largely data/cloud/ML-focused and does not match the Android Software Engineer priorities. Strengths: clear technical metrics (1M+ records pipeline, 5× faster feedback loops, model accuracy +5%, toxicity −8%, Alfred project reduced apply time 60% and increased applications 300%), solid cloud/AWS and backend/API experience, and relevant degrees/certifications. Shortcomings: missing core Android requirements—no Java/Kotlin or Android SDK, no mobile UI, multithreading, or memory-management experience, no evidence of shipping Android apps to millions of users, and likely insufficient years of Android/industry experience or organizational leadership called for by Meta. Also lacks Meta/role-specific keywords and Android-focused outcomes, so the resume appears un-tailored to this posting.
Impact: The resume contains multiple clear actions with measurable outcomes (high-scoring bullets per Step 1): e.g., AWS intern: automated sentiment pipeline processing 1M+ records with 5× faster feedback loops and SageMaker fine-tuning improving accuracy ~5% and reducing toxicity ~8%; Alfred project: 60% reduction in time-to-apply and 300% increase in weekly applications; IT Instructor: 36 lessons for 200+ learners and 96% graduation rate; IT Support: refurbished 800+ devices. These concrete metrics satisfy Step 2 and drive the rating up. Shortcomings: several bullets remain vague or lack outcomes (e.g., “Designed and presented secure, scalable AWS reference architectures,” many Software Developer Intern bullets and vendor-management/diagram bullets), and a handful of non-actionable phrasings reduce clarity — per Step 3 I applied modest penalties for these. Balancing the strong, metric-backed accomplishments against the weaker, metric-less bullets (Step 4), the normalized average corresponds to a high but not perfect score.

Tone: Professionalism 5/5 — polished, consistent resume formatting with clear headings and concise bullets. Action-Oriented 5/5 — strong verbs (Designed, Built, Automated, Fine-tuned) and clear, quantified impacts (1M+ records processed, 5× faster feedback loops, ~5% accuracy gain, ~8% toxicity reduction, 96% cohort graduation). Persona Alignment 5/5 — excellent match to a cloud/ML Solutions Architect role with relevant AWS services (Bedrock, SageMaker, Glue, QuickSight), RAG/CI-CD experience, and certifications. Average = 5.0; no individual score deviates from the average by ≥2.
Alignment: Strong alignment with the role’s cloud + AI requirements: resume explicitly lists AWS Solutions Architect certification and hands-on AWS experience (Bedrock, SageMaker, Glue, Lambda, QuickSight), designed secure, scalable architectures, built LLM POCs and a RAG system — matching key responsibilities and tools. Measurable outcomes are present and quantified (1M+ records, 5× faster feedback, ~5% accuracy improvement, ~8% toxicity reduction, 96% cohort grad rate). Partial/absent elements: no explicit mention of Outlier AI or Scale AI or role-specific customization (title/company tailoring missing). Weighted match (responsibilities 40% + tools 30% + outcomes 20% = high) offset by a customization penalty, yielding the final score.
Impact: I counted bullets that include an action verb, specific metric, and explicit business outcome: four bullets meet all three (Automated sentiment pipeline processing 1M+ records with 5× faster feedback loops; Fine‑tuned SageMaker models with ~5% accuracy gain and ~8% toxicity reduction; Delivered 36 lessons to 200+ learners; Maintained a 96% cohort graduation rate). Many other bullets have clear actions but lack measurable metrics or explicit business outcomes (e.g., “Designed and presented secure, scalable AWS reference architectures”; “Built POCs…to deliver actionable sentiment insights” lacks numbers). I assigned provisional 1–10 scores per bullet using the rubric, applied penalties for missing/measurable results and vague phrasing, averaged the penalized sub-scores across bullets, and rounded to map to the 1–10 scale, yielding the final score below.

Tone: Highly professional formatting and grammar with clear headings and contact info, meeting the Professionalism criterion. Action-oriented language is consistent—bullets begin with strong verbs (Designed, Built, Automated, Fine-tuned) and include measurable outcomes (1M+ records, 5× faster feedback loops, ~5% accuracy improvement, ~8% toxicity reduction). Persona alignment is strong for cloud/data/AI roles, citing AWS (Bedrock, SageMaker, Athena/Glue/Lambda), FastAPI, and relevant tools and projects that match the Solutions Architect/Data Science target. These specific strengths justify a top rating across the three evaluated dimensions.
Alignment: The resume only partially matches the Android Software Engineer requirements. Exact matches: Java and Android SDK are listed in Core Skills, and scalable architecture experience is shown via AWS reference architectures and a measurable pipeline (1M+ records, 5× faster feedback). Partial matches: cross-functional collaboration (vendor relations, teaching, AWS presentations), API experience (Postman/FastAPI). Missing or weak: no demonstrated Android app delivery or production shipping to millions of users, no mobile-specific skills like multithreading or memory management, no explicit unit-testing/API design ownership, and the candidate lacks the senior experience level (8+ years) and leadership/mentorship evidence required. The resume also uses some generic language and is not tailored to Meta/Android role priorities, so penalties apply. Overall, most high-priority Android-specific and senior qualifications are absent or only implied.
Impact: I scored this a mid-level rating because a few bullets show clear actions plus concrete metrics (the AWS sentiment pipeline: “1M+ records” and “5× faster feedback loops”; SageMaker fine-tune: “~5%” accuracy and “~8%” toxicity reduction; Instructor: “36 lessons for 200+ learners” and “96% cohort graduation rate”), which drove the score up. However, many bullets lack measurable outcomes or use vague/non-actionable phrasing (e.g., “Designed and presented secure, scalable AWS reference architectures,” “Built POCs… to deliver actionable insights,” WOPLLI and Mayor’s Office bullets, and the Alfred project), so I applied penalties for vagueness/passive wording. I rated each bullet (high for the quantitative AWS and instructor bullets, mid-to-low for the rest), subtracted points for unclear/passive language, averaged the per-bullet scores, and normalized to the final integer score.

Tone: High professionalism and polish: clear formatting, grammatically strong, complete contact/education sections, and quantifiable achievements (e.g., automated pipeline processing over 1M records; SageMaker accuracy +~5%; 96% graduation rate; CI/CD reduced application time by 60%). Strong action orientation: bullets begin with verbs (Designed, Automated, Fine-tuned, Developed) and emphasize measurable impact. Persona alignment slightly weaker: the summary highlights 8+ years of Android experience, but the experience and projects focus more on cloud/ML/IT internships and FastAPI work rather than Android app development, creating a small mismatch between stated persona and supporting evidence. Overall average of the three rubric dimensions maps to a high score.
Alignment: The resume partially matches the job: it explicitly lists Java and Android SDK, claims 8+ years of experience and references scalable architecture, cross-functional collaboration, and data-driven optimizations (e.g., 1M-record pipeline, 5x improvement). However, high-priority, role-specific items are weak or missing: no clear Android production role or documented shipping of a large-scale Android product supporting millions (the “millions” claim is unsubstantiated by projects/roles), no evidence of multithreading or mobile memory management experience, limited unit-testing/API-design detail, and no concrete examples of leading teams/mentoring or setting technical direction. The resume also relies on some generic summary language and internships rather than senior Android engineering experience, so it earns partial matches with notable gaps.
Impact: Strong points: several bullets include explicit actions plus clear metrics — e.g., AWS: automated sentiment-analysis pipeline processing over 1M records with a 5x feedback-loop improvement, SageMaker tuning (+~5% accuracy, −~8% toxicity); RF CUNY: 36 lessons to 200+ learners with a 96% graduation rate; Project: CI/CD reduced application time by 60% — these bullets drove the rating up. Shortcomings: many bullets are vague or lack measurable outcomes (""Designed secure, scalable AWS architectures..."", Virtual Credential System, Azure configuration, API/vendor work, ""significantly reducing"" manual workload, developed testing materials, FastAPI resume system) and use non-actionable phrasing; per the rubric I applied a 2–4 point penalty to seven such bullets. I scored each bullet, averaged and normalized to produce the final rating, which reflects the mix of strong metric-backed accomplishments and several under-specified items that pulled the overall score down.

Tone: High professionalism: clear, well-formatted resume with formal tone, correct grammar, and consistent sections (Contact, Summary, Skills, Experience, Education, Certifications). High action-orientation: bullets begin with strong verbs (Automated, Designed, Developed, Delivered, Reduced) and include measurable outcomes (1M+ records, 5× faster, 30%, 40%, 96% graduation), demonstrating results focus. Strong persona alignment: content is tailored to cloud/solutions roles (AWS internship, Solutions Architect title, AWS/Azure skills, CI/CD, APIs) and relevant certifications, matching the target technologist profile. All three evaluation dimensions warrant top ratings, producing the maximum aggregated score.
Alignment: The resume is largely misaligned with the Meta Android Software Engineer requirements. Top-priority items from the job—explicit Android app development using the Android SDK/Java (2+ years), shipping large-scale mobile products for millions of users, multithreading/mobile memory management, senior-level experience (leadership/mentorship, 8+ years or equivalent), and ownership/architecture of mobile components—are missing. Partial matches include Java listed as a language, cloud/architecture experience (AWS scalable designs), CI/CD, APIs/microservices, and measurable internship outcomes (performance and automation gains). However, those are cloud/data-focused rather than mobile/Android-specific, and the resume lacks company/title-specific keywords, senior role metrics, and evidence of shipping production Android apps. Given the few partial overlaps and significant missing Android- and senior-level requirements, the alignment is very low.
Impact: Following the evaluation steps, I rated individual bullet strength, specificity, and penalized vague/passive phrasing. Strong bullets with explicit actions + metrics (AWS: automated sentiment pipeline processing 1M+ records and 5× faster feedback loops; Alfred: 60% time reduction and 300% more weekly applications; Instructor: 36 lessons to 200+ learners with 96% graduation; WOPLLI: 30% deployment efficiency; Mayor’s Office: 40% workload reduction) drove the score up. Weaker bullets lacked measurable outcomes or used non‑actionable phrasing (""Designed scalable AWS architectures, enhancing customer security and performance""; ""Virtual Credential System…enhancing decentralized identity security""; ""CI/CD pipeline…enhancing project efficiency"" and the vague ""excellent service reviews""). Per step 3 I subtracted points for those vague bullets. Averaging the per-bullet scores (with penalties) and normalizing produced the final rating.

Excellent persona alignment: content and terminology map directly to a cloud/AI/data-science solutions role (AWS services like Bedrock, SageMaker, Glue; Azure; LLMs; agentic tooling; Alfred project; relevant certifications). No major shortcomings identified in tone or tailoring for the target role—resume is concise, achievement-focused, and industry-appropriate.
Alignment: Extracted priorities: LLM/model work, data quality/annotation, AI safety/guardrails, data pipelines/tools, and measurable outcomes. Matches: strong explicit LLM & generative AI experience (prompt structuring, fine-tuning, Bedrock, SageMaker) and pipeline/tooling (Glue, Athena, QuickSight, AWS services) with concrete metrics (1M+ records, ~5% accuracy gain, ~8% toxicity reduction, 5× faster dashboards). Also includes a model evaluation framework and guardrails (exact/strong). Partial/missing: no explicit mention of dataset labeling/annotation, human-in-the-loop quality review, or crowdsourcing/quality-submission workflows central to Outlier’s role; no Outlier/Scale AI or role-specific tailoring; title is more solutions/architect-focused than a Data Scientist label. Given many high-priority technical matches but key domain-specific responsibilities and company-specific tailoring are missing, the output merits a score in the upper-mid range.
Impact: The resume contains multiple bullets with explicit actions plus strong measurable outcomes (drove score up): AWS role — automated sentiment pipeline processing 1M+ records and producing 5× faster feedback loops; SageMaker fine-tuning with ~5% accuracy gain and ~8% toxicity reduction; Alfred project — 60% reduction in application time and 300% increase in weekly applications; IT Instructor — 36 lessons for 200+ learners with a 96% graduation rate; IT Support — refurbished/tracked 800+ devices. These bullets earn high individual scores per the evaluation steps. Shortcomings that reduced the rating: several bullets are action-oriented but lack concrete metrics or business impact (e.g., “Designed and presented secure, scalable AWS reference architectures,” WOPLLI items like producing diagrams or configuring Azure environments), and a few entries use vague/non-actionable phrasing (about 2–4 bullets), which incur the prescribed penalties.

Tone: High marks across the three evaluation steps: Professionalism is strong — clear, formal formatting and good grammar throughout the resume. Action-oriented — bullets begin with strong verbs and include measurable results (processed 1M+ records, 5× faster feedback-to-action, 5% accuracy improvement, 8% reduction in toxicity, 60% time savings, 300% increase in completed applications). Persona alignment is excellent for cloud/ML/Solutions Architect roles, with relevant AWS services (Bedrock, SageMaker, Lambda, QuickSight), certifications, and project details. Minor improvement: add a bit more quantification/context for earlier internship tasks, but overall the output meets the evaluation criteria well.
Alignment: The resume matches several high-priority items from the job posting: explicit generative-AI/LLM work (Bedrock, SageMaker, OpenAI), data pipeline experience (Glue, Athena, automated pipeline processing 1M records), RAG/embeddings (pgvector), and measurable outcomes (1M records processed, 5× faster feedback-to-action, 5% accuracy gain, 8% toxicity reduction, 60% time savings on applications). These are exact or strong partial matches to the requirement to improve AI model performance and data-driven tooling. Shortcomings: no mention of Outlier or Scale AI, and it omits explicit dataset labeling/annotation, human-in-the-loop quality control, or submission-quality review processes emphasized by the posting. Some language is somewhat generic (solutions-focused technologist) rather than tailored to the company/role, so points were deducted per the penalty step.
Impact: I scored this a 6 based on the stepwise rubric. I evaluated each bullet for explicit action plus measurable outcome: strong bullets (drove the score up) include the AWS sentiment pipeline (processed >1M records, 5× faster feedback-to-action), SageMaker fine-tuning (5% accuracy ↑, 8% toxicity ↓), Alfred project impact (60% faster application time, 300% more completed apps), and the instructor role (36 lessons for 200+ learners, 96% graduation rate) — these contain clear actions and concrete metrics and received high per-bullet scores. Mid/low-scoring bullets (drove the score down) include several AWS and project bullets that describe work (architecture design, POC development, CI/CD, Azure config, API scripts, IT support) but lack measurable results or timeframes, and WOPLLI/Mayor’s Office entries that are vague. I applied the rubric’s specificity check (credit for numeric metrics) and penalized passive/non-actionable phrasing (2–4 point reductions reflected in lower per-bullet scores). The final rating is the normalized average of per-bullet scores, yielding a mid-range 6 reflecting a mix of strong, metrics-driven accomplishments and several vague/metric-less bullets.
CredTail: Ground truth extracted from Retrieval Context: Degrees — MS in Data Science & Machine Learning (CUNY School of Professional Studies), expected Jan 2026, GPA 4.0, Dean’s List 2x; B.Tech in Computer Information Systems (CUNY NYC College of Technology), Jun 2024, GPA 3.78, Dean’s List 5x, National Honor Society. Employers/dates — AWS (Solutions Architect Intern) Jun 2025–Sep 2025; WOPLLI Technologies (Software Developer Intern) Jun 2024–Sep 2024; Mayor’s Office of Information Services (IT Support Intern) Feb 2024–May 2024; RF CUNY & Generation USA (IT Instructor Assistant) Feb 2022–Aug 2023. Core technologies/projects — AWS (EC2, S3, Lambda, RDS, DynamoDB, Glue, QuickSight, Bedrock, Macie, SageMaker), Azure, FastAPI, PostgreSQL+pgvector, OpenAI GPT-4.1 mini, Docker, CI/CD, Python (pandas, scikit-learn, PyTorch), Postman, etc. Comparison against Actual Output: Degrees — MS: Partial Match (degree, date, GPA match but Actual output omits the specific CUNY SPS school name and MS honor entry); B.Tech: Exact Match. Employers & dates: All Exact Matches. Core technologies: Mostly Exact (AWS services largely present) but Macie from Retrieval Context is Missing in Actual Output (Missing). Projects tech (FastAPI, pgvector, GPT-4.1 mini, Docker) — Exact. Certifications: AWS Solutions Architect, AWS AI Practitioner, Google Cybersecurity — Exact; Google Information Support Certificate present in Retrieval Context is Missing in Actual Output (Missing). Honors: Bachelor's Dean’s List (5x) and National Honor Society — Exact; MS Dean’s List (2x) present in Retrieval Context is Missing in Actual Output (Missing). Fabrications: None detected (no claims contradicted by context). Penalties applied: -1 for missing Macie (core tech), -1 for missing Google Information Support Certificate, -0.5 for omission of MS Dean’s List detail (minor honor omission). Starting from full alignment, these deductions yield a final rounded credibility score of 8. Justification: The Actual Output closely mirrors the Retrieval Context (accurate employers, dates, degrees, major core technologies and project details) with only minor omissions (additional certification, one AWS service, and an MS honor/subschool detail) that reduce completeness but do not indicate fabrication.",63,2025-12-18 18:56:45.166972,6,8
32,1364,P2,9.565217391304348,10,7,40.565217391304344,"Punctuality: The score is 0.96 because the actual output claims Dean's List (5x) while the retrieval context contains conflicting entries—one line lists Dean's List (5x) and an artifact line later lists Dean's List (8x); the claim of 5x directly conflicts with the artifact stating 8x (context shows 8x in artifacts), so verify the correct number.
Tone: Strong professional resume: clear headings, consistent formatting, correct grammar, and relevant certifications (AWS, Google). Action-oriented with frequent strong verbs and measurable achievements (e.g., automated pipeline processing 1M+ records, 5× faster feedback loops, SageMaker fine-tuning improving accuracy ~5% and reducing toxicity ~8%). Persona alignment is excellent for cloud/ML/solutions-architect roles — targeted experience (AWS Solutions Architect Intern, Bedrock/Glue/Athena, QuickSight), relevant project (Alfred agentic assistant), and appropriate skills list. Minor shortcoming: a few entries (some internships) could use additional quantification or tighter impact phrasing for parity with the strongest bullets.
Alignment: Top priorities extracted: AI/LLM safety, producing high‑quality training data/annotation, instruction tuning, and measurable improvements. Exact matches: explicit LLM work (Bedrock, OpenAI GPT-4/4.1), fine‑tuning in SageMaker with measurable gains (~5% accuracy, ~8% toxicity reduction), large‑scale pipeline automation (1M+ records, 5× faster feedback). Partial matches: data‑quality/QA skills via dashboards and pipelines but not explicitly labeling/annotation or crowdsourced data curation. Missing: any mention of annotation platforms, labeling guidelines, or Outlier/Scale AI/company‑specific keywords. Resume is technical and metric‑driven (limits generic language penalty) but lacks the core labeling/quality control domain experience the role emphasizes, so scoring reflects mostly matched technical skills but key domain gap.
Impact: I scored the resume a 5 because evaluation across 15 bullets produced a mid-range average (≈4.7 → 5) after applying the rubric: bullets that included explicit actions plus concrete metrics scored highest (AWS sentiment pipeline: “1M+ records” and “5× faster feedback loops”; SageMaker fine-tune: “~5% accuracy” and “~8% toxicity” improvement; Instructor Assistant: “36 lessons for 200+ learners” and “96% cohort graduation rate”) and drove the rating up. Many other bullets contained clear actions but lacked measurable outcomes (e.g., “Designed and presented secure, scalable AWS architectures,” WOPLLI project bullets, several Project bullets), so they received mid/low scores and were penalized per the rule to subtract points for non-actionable/vague phrasing. Overall the mix of a few strong, metric-backed accomplishments and numerous vague/no-metric bullets produced a normalized, mid-level score.
CredTail: Ground truth (from Retrieval Context): Master of Science in Data Science & Machine Learning — City University of New York (School of Professional Studies), Expected Jan 2026, GPA 4.0; Bachelor of Technology in Computer Information Systems — City University of New York (NYC College of Technology), Jun 2024, GPA 3.78, Dean’s List (5x), National Honor Society; Employers and dates — Amazon Web Services (Solutions Architect Intern) Jun 2025–Sep 2025; WOPLLI Technologies (Software Developer Intern) Jun 2024–Sep 2024; Mayor’s Office of Information Services (IT Support Intern) Feb 2024–May 2024; RF CUNY & Generation USA (IT Instructor Assistant) Feb 2022–Aug 2023; Core technologies — Python (pandas, scikit-learn, PyTorch), AWS (EC2, S3, Lambda, RDS, DynamoDB, Glue, QuickSight, Bedrock, SageMaker), Azure, FastAPI, PostgreSQL+pgvector, OpenAI GPT-4.1 mini, Docker, CI/CD, Postman, Power BI, QuickSight, Active Directory/CrowdStrike. Comparison (Actual Output vs Retrieval Context): Degrees — Master: Partial Match (Actual lists CUNY but omits explicit “School of Professional Studies” label); Bachelor: Exact Match. Employers & dates — Exact Match for all listed roles and dates. Core technologies — Mostly Exact Matches (key AWS, ML, FastAPI, OpenAI, PostgreSQL + pgvector, Docker, CI/CD present); minor formatting/name variations (e.g., “GPT-4 Mini” vs “GPT-4.1 mini”) are minor. Missing items — “Google Information Support Certificate” appears in Retrieval Context artifacts but is omitted from the Actual Output (deducted as a missing item). Fabrications — none detected. Deductions applied: one-point deduction for the missing Google Information Support Certificate and minor institution-name omission counted as a partial mismatch. Justification: the Actual Output accurately reproduces employers, dates, degrees, and core technologies from the Retrieval Context with only a small omission and a small institution-name variation, so overall credibility is high.",64,2025-12-18 18:59:50.136487,5,9
36,1364,P3,10,10,8,41,"Punctuality: The score is 1.00 because the Contradictions list is empty, indicating the actual output fully aligns with the retrieval context — nicely done!
Tone: Resume exhibits highly professional, consistent language and formatting suitable for a resume. It is action-oriented with pervasive strong verbs (Designed, Developed, Built, Fine-tuned) and concrete results (processed over 1M feedback records, 5× faster feedback-to-action turnaround, 5% accuracy gain, 8% toxicity reduction). Tone, skills, and accomplishments closely align with a Generative AI/Cloud Data Scientist persona and the target company (mentions SageMaker, Bedrock, Lambda, AWS certifications, and AI safety focus). No notable deficiencies in professionalism, action focus, or persona fit were found.
Alignment: Evaluation extracted top priorities: AI safety/intelligence, high-quality training data for LLMs, generative AI/LLM fine-tuning, data pipelines/feedback loops, and remote collaboration. The resume explicitly matches many items: generative AI and fine-tuning LLMs (SageMaker), AWS tooling including Bedrock/Lambda, a scaled pipeline processing 1M records, and measurable outcomes (5× faster feedback, +5% accuracy, −8% toxicity). It partially matches feedback-loop and operational-efficiency responsibilities but lacks explicit annotation/labeling, human-in-the-loop or expert-crowdsourcing experience (key to Outlier/Scale-style data work). The resume is somewhat tailored (mentions Outlier AI in summary) and contains concrete metrics, so most high-priority items are met but important role-specific tasks are missing, warranting a mid-high score.
Impact: I scored each of the 12 resume bullets for explicit action + measurable outcome, applied vagueness/passive penalties, then averaged and normalized per the instructions. Major strengths that drove the score up: the AWS sentiment pipeline bullet (processed >1M records and enabled a 5× faster feedback-to-action turnaround), the model fine-tuning bullet (5% accuracy improvement and 8% toxicity reduction), and the instructional bullets (36 lessons for 200+ learners and a 96% cohort graduation rate) — all contain clear actions plus concrete metrics. Main weaknesses that pulled the score down: multiple bullets are non-specific or lack outcomes (e.g., “Designed and presented secure, scalable AWS architectures,” the POC bullet, Virtual Credential system, configured Azure environments, API/testing scripts, automated troubleshooting, monitoring/escalation, and VIP support); these were penalized for vague/non-actionable phrasing. I applied 2-point penalties to ambiguous bullets as prescribed, ranked bullets by their resulting quality, and averaged those scores to produce the final rating. Overall the resume shows strong measurable AI and instructional impact but has several generic bullets that need clear metrics or outcomes.
CredTail: Ground truth from Retrieval Context: MS in Data Science & Machine Learning (CUNY SPS), expected Jan 2026, GPA 4.0; B.Tech in Computer Information Systems (CUNY NYC College of Technology), Jun 2024, GPA 3.78, Dean’s List (5x) & National Honor Society; Experience: AWS (Solutions Architect Intern) Jun 2025–Sep 2025; WOPLLI (Software Developer Intern) Jun 2024–Sep 2024; Mayor’s Office IT Support Feb 2024–May 2024; RF CUNY / Generation USA IT Instructor Assistant Feb 2022–Aug 2023; Core techs in context include Python, R, SQL, AWS (EC2, S3, Lambda, SageMaker, Bedrock, Glue, QuickSight, etc.), Docker, Git, Power BI, FastAPI, PostgreSQL+pgvector, OpenAI GPT models. Actual Output strengths: high fidelity to retrieval for education, employer names, employment dates, and detailed AWS/ML accomplishments (sentiment pipeline 1M+, SageMaker fine-tuning metrics) — these are Exact Matches. Deductions applied for missing claimed technologies not present in the Retrieval Context: Java (claimed in Technical Skills) — Missing (claimed but absent) → -1; Tableau (claimed in Tools & Frameworks) — Missing → -1. Minor ambiguity: Dean’s List counts are presented without degree mapping (Retrieval shows MS Dean’s List 2x, BTech 5x) — Partial discrepancy but low severity (no further deduction). No fabricated (contradicted) items found. Final score reflects strong alignment with a few minor missing claims tied to the retrieval artifact evidence.",65,2025-12-18 19:03:24.57242,5,8
38,1627,P1,9.795918367346939,10,3,40.79591836734694,"Punctuality: The score is 0.98 because the actual output overstated Dean's List for New York City College of Technology as 8x while the retrieval context lists Dean's List (5x); this single quantitative miscount is the only noted contradiction.
Tone: Professionalism: 5 — consistently formal, industry-appropriate, and error-free (clear headings, certifications, and polished formatting). Action-Oriented: 5 — frequent strong action verbs and quantified outcomes (built a pipeline processing >1M records, enabled 5× faster feedback-to-action, 5% accuracy gain, 8% toxicity reduction; 60% time reduction and 300% increase in applications). Persona Alignment: 5 — tone and content clearly match a Solutions Architect/Data Science candidate working with AWS, Bedrock, SageMaker, and ML pipelines. Numeric average (1–5) = 5.0; scaled to 0–10 = 10. Highest/lowest: all categories tied at the top score; no major shortcomings identified.
Alignment: Extracted requirements: Amazon Connect / Contact Center solutions (WFM, CRM), AWS WWSO Apps, partner/go-to-market ownership, senior WW specialist scope, AWS architecture and integrations. Direct matches: AWS architecture and named services (EC2, S3, Lambda, Glue, QuickSight, SageMaker) and measurable project outcomes (1M records, 5× faster turnaround, 5%/8% model improvements, 60% time reduction, 300% application increase) — demonstrates strong AWS/ML/data-pipeline expertise and quantification. Close/paraphrase: data analytics experience could loosely map to contact-center analytics but there is no explicit mention of contact center domains. Missing/no mention: Amazon Connect, Contact Lens, WFM, CRM integrations (e.g., Salesforce), partner or go-to-market ownership, senior/global specialist responsibilities; role seniority mismatch (resume shows intern-level roles). Given a partial match on core AWS skills and excellent quantified results but critical absence of domain-specific Amazon Connect/Contact Center and partner/senior responsibilities, the combined match rate and penalties yield a low score.
Impact: Resume contains multiple strong action-oriented bullets with clear, specific metrics tied to impact (e.g., built a pipeline processing over 1M feedback records with 5× faster feedback-to-action, fine-tuned models with a 5% accuracy gain and 8% reduction in toxicity, Alfred reduced application time by 60% and increased applications 300%, 36 lessons for 200+ learners with a 96% graduation rate). These are measurable and business-relevant (throughput, accuracy, time savings). Deductions for several vague or passive bullets lacking metrics or baselines (e.g., “designed and presented secure architectures,” “designed VCS,” “configured and tested Azure environments”), which reduce consistency of quantification across the resume.
CredTail: Most claims are VERIFIED against the Retrieval Context: all four experience entries (Solutions Architect Intern at AWS Jun 2025–Sep 2025; Software Developer Intern Jun 2024–Sep 2024; IT Support Feb 2024–May 2024; IT Instructor Feb 2022–Aug 2023) and their highlights match; education degrees, dates and GPAs (MS expected Jan 2026, GPA 4.0; B.Tech June 2024, GPA 3.78) are present; certifications and the Alfred project/tech stack (FastAPI, PostgreSQL+pgvector, OpenAI GPT-4.1 mini, Docker, CI/CD) and the listed core skills largely match. One contradicted item was found: the Bachelor’s “Dean’s List (8x)” in the Actual Output is contradicted by the Retrieval Context (Dean’s List listed as 5x). Per the evaluation rules this contradiction is treated as a fabrication and a strong penalty was applied to the Education subscore. Category subscores used: Education ~6/10 (penalized for the contradicted Dean’s List count), Experience 10/10, Core Skills 10/10. Aggregating and applying the fabrication penalty yields the final credibility score based on the verified majority of claims and the single notable contradiction.",89,2025-12-18 19:04:54.583268,9,9

Tone: High marks across all three evaluation steps: Professionalism (formal tone, clean headings, consistent formatting, no casual language), Action-Oriented (numerous strong verbs and clear quantified outcomes such as “1M feedback records,” “5× faster feedback-to-action,” “5% increase in output accuracy,” “8% reduction in toxicity,” “60% time reduction,” “300% increase”), and Persona Alignment (role- and industry-specific terminology and tools aligned to Solutions Architect/AI roles — e.g., AWS services, Bedrock, SageMaker, QuickSight, RAG, FastAPI). Only minor nitpick is a small redundancy in the location line, but no material shortcomings that affected scoring.
Alignment: Partial match: strong AWS technical tools and measurable outcomes are present (e.g., SageMaker, Bedrock, Glue, QuickSight; a 1M‑record sentiment pipeline, 5× faster feedback-to-action, 5% accuracy gain), which aligns with the job’s technical expectations but not the contact‑center domain. Missing core required items: no Amazon Connect, contact‑center/WFM/CRM experience, and no go‑to‑market/partner ownership or partner growth responsibilities. Resume has concrete metrics (good) but lacks senior/partner GTM language (moderate penalty applied), yielding a final mapped score based on ~35% fit.
Impact: Strong active ownership with many action verbs (designed, developed, built, fine-tuned, deployed) and concrete tasks. Multiple measurable results are present: processed over 1M feedback records, 5× faster feedback-to-action, 5% accuracy increase and 8% toxicity reduction in models, 60% time reduction and 300% increase in completed applications, and a 96% cohort graduation rate. Metrics are tied to clear business outcomes (faster feedback-to-action, increased application throughput, reduced manual workload). Minor shortcoming: a few metrics lack explicit baselines or timeframes (e.g., the 5% accuracy gain), so not every metric meets the strict baseline/timeframe requirement.
CredTail: All claims matched the Retrieval Context. I enumerated 30 total claimed items (2 degrees, 4 employers, 4 employment date entries, 20 core-technology/skill entries) and verified all 30 against the Retrieval Context (e.g., Master of Science – Data Science and Machine Learning, City University of New York – SPS, Expected Jan 2026; Bachelor of Technology – Computer Information Systems, NYC College of Technology, Jun 2024; Employers: AWS (Solutions Architect Intern, Jun 2025–Sep 2025), WOPLLI Technologies (Software Developer Intern, Jun 2024–Sep 2024), Mayor’s Office of Information Services (IT Support Intern, Feb 2024–May 2024), RF CUNY & Generation USA (IT Instructor Assistant, Feb 2022–Aug 2023); Core technologies: Python, SQL/NoSQL, AWS (EC2,S3,Lambda,RDS,DynamoDB,Glue,QuickSight,Bedrock,Macie,SageMaker), Azure, FastAPI, PostgreSQL/pgvector, Docker, etc.). There were no Missing, Contradicted, or Fabricated claims, so initial credibility (100% verified → top band) yielded the maximum mapped score and no penalties were applied.",87,2025-12-18 19:05:14.683725,9,10

Tone: Professionalism: highly formal and well-structured with clear headers, correct grammar, and consistent tone (clear contact, certifications, education, experience sections). Action-oriented: strong use of verbs and measurable outcomes throughout (e.g., pipeline processing >1M records, 5× faster feedback-to-action, 5% accuracy gain, 8% reduction in toxicity, 96% graduation rate). Persona alignment: excellent match to cloud/AI/ML roles—explicit AWS/Bedrock/SageMaker/Lambda experience, FastAPI + GPT-4.1 Mini RAG design, pgvector, CI/CD, and Docker. All categories are balanced with no category noticeably lower than the others, so the output merits top-scale evaluation based on the provided rubric.
Alignment: Strong AWS/ML evidence (Solutions Architect intern at AWS; explicit use of Bedrock, Glue, QuickSight, SageMaker; built a POC and a fully automated sentiment pipeline processing 1M+ records delivering 5× faster feedback-to-action and model accuracy/toxicity improvements), but it omits core job requirements: no Amazon Connect/Contact Center, no WFM or CRM experience, no AWS WWSO Apps mention, and no partner/go-to-market or senior WW specialist experience. Measurable outcomes earn a small bonus; mismatch on seniority/domain incurs a penalty, producing a low alignment score.
Impact: The resume shows multiple explicit action verbs and concrete metrics (e.g., processed over 1M feedback records, enabled 5× faster feedback-to-action turnaround, achieved a 5% accuracy increase and 8% reduction in toxicity, 96% cohort graduation rate, delivered 36 lessons to 200+ learners). Ownership is clear (Built, Fine-tuned, Designed, Deployed) and results tie to business impact (real-time dashboards, POC solutions). Minor unquantified bullets (Azure configuration, some architecture diagrams) introduce only slight vagueness, so the content merits a top evaluation.
CredTail: Most key fields are exact matches: personal info (name, location, email, phone, links), employers and roles (AWS Solutions Architect Intern; WOPLLI Software Developer Intern; Mayor’s Office IT Support; RF CUNY/Generation USA Instructor Assistant) and their dates match the Retrieval Context exactly. Core technologies and project details (FastAPI, PostgreSQL+pgvector, OpenAI GPT‑4.1 mini, Docker, AWS services including Bedrock/Glue/Athena/SageMaker/QuickSight) are verified. Education degrees, institutions, GPAs, and expected/master’s date match, but Bachelor’s honors count (Actual lists Dean’s List 8x vs Retrieval 5x) is a partial mismatch and Master’s Dean’s List honor from the Retrieval Context is omitted—these are minor inconsistencies rather than wholesale fabrications. Certifications largely align but the “Google Information Support Certificate” present in the Retrieval Context is missing from the Actual Output. Because all critical fields (degree, employer, date, core tech) are present and consistent and only minor/one non-critical certification and a honors count differ, the assessment reduces the highest rating slightly.",91,2025-12-18 19:06:04.732893,10,9

Tone: Professionalism: very strong—clean formatting, consistent grammar, clear sections (contact, education, certs, experience). Action-oriented: high prevalence of verbs and measurable impacts (e.g., automated sentiment pipeline processing 1M+ records for 5× faster feedback; SageMaker fine-tuning improved accuracy 5% and reduced toxicity 8%; Alfred reduced application time 60% and increased applications 300%). Persona alignment: generally well-matched to cloud/ML roles with AWS certs, SageMaker, and cloud tooling, but slightly underemphasizes architecture-level design, scalability decisions, and cross-team collaboration expected for a Solutions Architect role. Overall solid and impactful but could add more architecting and leadership details to be perfectly tailored.
Alignment: Good alignment on technical skills and measurable outcomes: resume shows LLM work (integrated OpenAI GPT-4.1), model fine‑tuning in SageMaker with explicit improvements (accuracy +5%, toxicity −8%), large automated data pipeline (1M+ records, 5× faster), and relevant tools (AWS, SageMaker, Python). However, it misses several high‑priority Outlier AI needs from the job description: no explicit experience with data labeling/annotation, dataset curation or QA workflows for training LLMs, and it does not reference Outlier/Scale AI or role‑specific keywords. Some role language is generic rather than focused on producing high‑quality training data for LLMs. Overall matches are mostly partial-to-exact but key annotation/quality responsibilities are missing, so the score reflects a mostly good but incomplete fit.
Impact: Followed the 4 evaluation steps: bullets with explicit actions + clear metrics scored highest (AWS bullets: 1M+ records and 5× faster; fine-tuning: +5% accuracy, -8% toxicity; Alfred project: -60% time, +300% weekly applications; instructor: 96% graduation of 200+ learners). Mid scores were given to action-first but metric-light bullets (Azure config; automated troubleshooting; GPT-4.1 integration) because they lack measurable outcomes. The security-log bullet used vague language (“effectively”) and received an additional penalty for being non-actionable. I applied 2–3 point penalties for passive/vague phrasing per step 3, ranked bullets relative to one another per step 4, and computed the final score as the normalized average — strong metric-driven bullets drove the rating up, while vague/metric-less bullets dragged it down.
CredTail: Ground truth (from Retrieval Context): Degrees — MS Data Science & Machine Learning (CUNY SPS, Expected Jan 2026, GPA 4.0); B.Tech Computer Information Systems (CUNY NYC College of Technology, Jun 2024, GPA 3.78). Employers & dates — AWS (Solutions Architect Intern, Jun 2025–Sep 2025); WOPLLI Technologies (Software Developer Intern, Jun 2024–Sep 2024); Mayor’s Office of Information Services (IT Support Intern, Feb 2024–May 2024); RF CUNY & Generation USA (IT Instructor Assistant, Feb 2022–Aug 2023). Core technologies called out in context — Python (pandas, scikit-learn, PyTorch), SQL/NoSQL, AWS (EC2,S3,Lambda,RDS,DynamoDB,Glue,QuickSight,Bedrock,Macie,SageMaker), Azure (App Service, Functions, Storage), FastAPI, PostgreSQL+pgvector, OpenAI GPT-4.1 mini, Docker, CI/CD, QuickSight/Power BI, SageMaker, Bedrock, Glue, etc. Comparison (Actual Output vs Retrieval Context): - Degrees: MS entry is an Exact Match in content and dates though Actual Output omits the explicit “School of Professional Studies” campus name (Partial Match). B.Tech is a Partial Match (degree, date, GPA match but campus phrasing omitted). - Employers & dates: All four internships and their dates are Exact Matches. - Projects: Alfred and the claims (60% time reduction, GPT-4.1 integration) are Exact Matches. - Core technologies: AWS & SageMaker, OpenAI GPT-4.1, FastAPI, Docker, pgvector-related items are Exact/Partial matches; Actual Output lists a narrower subset of AWS services (Partial Match). - Certifications: Three listed certs match, but Retrieval Context also lists an additional “Google Information Support Certificate” that Actual Output omits (Missing). Discrepancies / penalties applied: - Missing: Google Information Support Certificate — minor omission (deduct 1 point). - Partial omissions: omission of campus qualifier for MS and college phrasing for B.Tech (minor; no further deduction beyond overall rounding). - Fabricated/Unverified claims in Actual Output: Java and Tableau appear in Core Skills but are not present in the Retrieval Context (each treated as small fabrications; deduct 1 point each). Net assessment: The Actual Output aligns strongly with the Retrieval Context across education, employers/dates, projects, and core AWS/ML claims. Minor omissions and two small unverified skill claims reduce perfect alignment. Final score rationale: high accuracy with limited, low-severity issues leads to a credibility score of 8.",66,2025-12-18 19:06:06.757913,6,8

Tone: High professionalism: formal tone, clear sections, correct grammar, and polished vocabulary (professional summary, certifications, education). Strong action-orientation: uses active verbs and multiple quantified impacts (built sentiment pipeline processing 1M+ records, 5× faster feedback-to-action, 5% accuracy gain/8% toxicity reduction, 60% time saved/300% more applications). Excellent persona alignment: targets AWS Solutions Architect/Data Science roles with relevant certifications (AWS Solutions Architect, Bedrock/SageMaker experience), cloud and ML toolset, and internship/project evidence. Category scores are consistent (no two differ by more than 1). Minor nit: timeline shows future-dated internship and degree but does not materially reduce alignment.
Alignment: Low alignment with the job’s specialist responsibilities. Responsibilities: resume shows technical POC and architecture work (designed AWS architectures, presented POCs, enterprise-facing intern role) but does not demonstrate senior, go-to-market, partner ownership, or contact-center/WFM/CRM domain expertise—only a small subset of responsibilities matched. Tools/technologies: strong AWS footprint (Bedrock, Glue, Athena, Lambda, QuickSight, SageMaker) but no explicit Amazon Connect, WFM, CRM or WWSO Apps mention, so tool overlap is minimal. Outcomes/metrics: resume contains measurable results (1M+ records processed, 5× faster feedback-to-action, 5% accuracy gain, 8% toxicity reduction, 60% time savings, 300% increase in applications) tied to projects, giving solid metrics credit. Major shortcomings: not tailored to the Senior WW Specialist / Amazon Connect role, junior/intern-level experience, and missing role-specific language and partner/go-to-market accomplishments — therefore a significant penalty applied.
Impact: The resume includes multiple strong, action-oriented, measurable results tied to outcomes — e.g., a sentiment pipeline processing over 1M feedback records enabling a 5× faster feedback-to-action turnaround; fine-tuning with a 5% accuracy gain and 8% reduction in toxicity; a 96% cohort graduation rate; a 60% reduction in time-to-apply and a 300% increase in completed applications/week. These metrics demonstrate clear accomplishments and business impact. Shortcomings: a few claims lack baseline/context or explicit business KPIs (revenue, cost saved, or user impact) and there is some vague/passive language in parts of the summary, so the rating is reduced slightly for missing context and occasional imprecision.
CredTail: Most claims are directly supported by the retrieval context: both degrees (CUNY SPS MS expected Jan 2026 with GPA 4.0; NYC College of Technology B.Tech June 2024, GPA 3.78), all listed employers and dates (AWS Jun 2025–Sep 2025; WOPLLI Jun 2024–Sep 2024; Mayor’s Office Feb 2024–May 2024; RF CUNY & Generation USA Feb 2022–Aug 2023), and the bulk of core technologies (AWS services, SageMaker, Bedrock, Glue, QuickSight, Python/pandas/Scikit/PyTorch, PostgreSQL+pgvector, FastAPI, Docker, Git) match exactly. However there are a few minor inconsistencies that reduce credibility: the resume lists Tableau (not present in the retrieval core skills), and the Bachelor’s Dean’s List count differs (resume: 8x; retrieval: 5x).

Tone: Professionalism: 5 — consistently formal, well-formatted, and error-free presentation (clear headings, LinkedIn/GitHub links, strong education listings). Action-Oriented: 5 — frequent strong action verbs and clear quantified outcomes (e.g., processed over 1M records, 5× faster feedback-to-action, 5% accuracy gain, 8% toxicity reduction, 60% reduced application time, 300% increase in applications). Persona Alignment: 5 — tone and content strongly match a data-science/solutions-architect intern transitioning to MS-level work (AWS, SageMaker, Bedrock, Athena/Glue, RAG, ARIMA projects). Average = (5+5+5)/3 = 5.0 (mapped to score scale), highest and lowest ratings are equal across all three aspects.
Alignment: Extracted requirements: improve LLM intelligence & safety (data quality), model fine-tuning, large-scale data pipelines, RAG/embeddings, named tools (SageMaker/Bedrock/OpenAI/Postgres/Python), annotation/labeling & QA processes, measurable outcomes. Resume matches directly: fine-tuning in Amazon SageMaker with measured 5% accuracy gain and 8% toxicity reduction (direct match to safety/quality), generative AI work with Bedrock and GPT-4.1 and a RAG system using PostgreSQL (direct matches to LLM/RAG/tools), large pipeline processing 1M records and dashboards (direct match to data engineering/scale), strong use of Python/SQL and named AWS tools (direct). Close paraphrase: “improving data quality” is implied by accuracy/toxicity metrics but not tied to annotation/labeling workflows. Missing: explicit experience with data labeling/annotation platforms, crowd-sourced labeling or QA process design (key for Outlier’s data-for-LLMs focus), and explicit tailoring to the Outlier Scale/annotation context. Specificity is high (quantified outcomes, concrete projects, named tools), but penalized for lack of annotation/labeling and company-specific tailoring. Based on match rate (major technical matches), strong evidence, and two notable omissions, the overall alignment is high but not perfect.
Impact: High alignment with the evaluation steps: multiple bullets use clear action verbs and specific, business-relevant metrics — e.g., sentiment pipeline processing over 1M records enabling a 5× faster feedback-to-action turnaround; fine-tuning models yielding a 5% accuracy increase and 8% toxicity reduction; Alfred reducing time-to-apply by 60% and increasing weekly applications by 300%; and delivering 36 lessons to 200+ learners with a 96% graduation rate. Points deducted because several entries lack quantifiable results or baselines/timeframes (WOPLLI bullets, IT Support automation simply says “reducing manual workload,” ATM forecasting notes “improving forecast accuracy” without metrics), and a few vague phrases reduce clarity of business impact.
CredTail: Education: largely VERIFIED — Master of Science (CUNY SPS), expected Jan 2026 (GPA 4.0) and Bachelor of Technology (CUNY NYCCT), Jun 2024 (GPA 3.78) match the Retrieval Context (subscore ~10/10). Experience: VERIFIED — all four roles (AWS Solutions Architect Intern Jun 2025–Sep 2025 with Bedrock/Athena/Glue/QuickSight/SageMaker details, WOPLLI Jun 2024–Sep 2024, Mayor’s Office Feb–May 2024, RF CUNY Feb 2022–Aug 2023) are present and consistent (subscore 10/10). Core Skills: mostly VERIFIED (Python, R, SQL, PostgreSQL, MySQL, NoSQL, Docker, Git, Power BI, ML/statistics, etc.) but three claimed items are absent from the Retrieval Context and treated as missing/fabricated: Java, JavaScript, Tableau. Initial core-skills proportion ≈10/13 → ~7.7/10, then a strong penalty for the three missing items reduces this category (treated here as ~5/10). Aggregating Education (10), Experience (10), Core Skills (~5) → final credibility 8/10. Fabricated/missing items: Java; JavaScript; Tableau. Minor inconsistency: Dean’s List counts (Actual states 5× generally while structured data shows 5× for bachelor and 2× for master). These missing items in Core Skills drove the score reduction.",99,2025-12-18 19:07:36.218982,9,8

Tone: Professionalism: strong — clear headings, consistent formatting, correct grammar, and well-structured sections (contact, summary, competencies, experience, projects, education). Action-Oriented: strong — frequent action verbs and quantified outcomes throughout (e.g., “1M+ records,” “5× faster feedback loops,” “~5% accuracy improvement,” “reduced toxicity ~8%,” “60% time reduction,” “300% increase”), showing results focus. Persona Alignment: strong — tone, terminology, and emphasis align to a Solutions Architect / data/ML role (AWS services, Bedrock, SageMaker, LLMs, ETL, CI/CD, QuickSight) and projects reinforce that seniority. Overall there are no notable weaknesses across the three evaluated areas, so the averaged assessment reflects top marks.
Alignment: Weighted match ≈71% → mapped to score 8. Strengths: explicit tool matches (LLMs, PyTorch, SageMaker, AWS/Bedrock), concrete responsibilities and outcomes (automated ETL pipeline processing 1M+ records, 5× faster feedback loops, fine-tuning improvements ~+5% accuracy and -8% toxicity, RAG/OpenAI projects). Partial matches: data curation/annotation and collaboration with expert/top-AI labs inferred but not stated. Missing: explicit experience with annotation platforms or quality-based submission systems. No strong generic-content penalty applied.
Impact: High use of action-oriented language (many strong verbs: Designed, Built, Automated, Fine-tuned, Developed, Managed, Delivered) and concrete tasks—meets the top tier for ownership. Strong measurable results are present: 1M+ records processed, 5× faster feedback loops, ~5% accuracy gain and ~8% toxicity reduction, 60% faster application time and 300% boost in weekly applications, refurbished 800+ devices, 96% cohort graduation—multiple clear metrics and internship/project timeframes. Business impact is explicit in several cases (efficiency/throughput improvements, product quality gains, increased engagement), justifying a high impact score. Minor shortcoming: several improvements lack an explicit baseline or direct revenue/cost figures, but passive voice is minimal. Overall alignment with the evaluation steps is strong.
CredTail: All claims checked against the Retrieval Context are supported. Degrees: Master of Science (CUNY SPS, Expected Jan 2026) and Bachelor of Technology (CUNY NYC College of Technology, Jun 2024) — Verified (2/2).

Action-Oriented: strong action verbs and measurable outcomes throughout (e.g., processed 1M+ records, 5× faster feedback loops, ~5% accuracy improvement, 96% cohort graduation). Persona Alignment: content and tech stack map closely to data science/cloud/solutions-architect roles (AWS, SageMaker, RAG, FastAPI, CI/CD). No notable weaknesses or imbalances across categories.
Alignment: Strong alignment with Outlier AI's needs: resume explicitly shows LLM work (Bedrock, GPT-4.1), fine-tuning in SageMaker with measurable gains (≈5% accuracy improvement, −8% toxicity), large-scale data pipelines/analytics (Athena/Glue/Lambda, 1M+ records, 5× faster), and RAG/pgvector for high-quality retrieval — which maps well to the job’s focus on improving intelligence and safety of AI models; only notable gap is no explicit mention of data-labeling/annotation workflow experience, so a minor omission.
Impact: Strong use of action verbs and multiple measurable results (e.g., automated pipeline processing 1M+ records, 5× faster feedback loops, ~5% accuracy improvement, ~8% toxicity reduction, 96% cohort graduation rate for 200+ learners) shows clear ownership and business impact. Minor shortcoming: several bullets (Virtual Credential System, Azure configuration, API testing) lack quantified outcomes, so a small vagueness penalty applies.
CredTail: Most key fields align with the Retrieval Context: employer names and dates for all four roles (AWS Jun 2025–Sep 2025; WOPLLI Jun 2024–Sep 2024; Mayor’s Office Feb 2024–May 2024; RF CUNY/Generation Feb 2022–Aug 2023) are exact matches. Projects and core technologies (FastAPI, PostgreSQL+pgvector, Docker, AWS services, SageMaker, Glue, QuickSight) are largely consistent with the artifacts. Shortcomings: the Master’s entry omits the retrieval-listed 4.0 GPA and honors (partial match on education/institution naming), one certification from the retrieval (“Google Information Support Certificate”) is omitted, and some core-skill items (e.g., explicit Bedrock/Macie in the core-skills list) are only implied rather than listed. No fabricated items were found. Given exact matches on employers/dates and mostly consistent core techs but a missing critical education detail and one omitted certification, the credibility score reflects a minor-gap level of alignment.",100,2025-12-18 19:08:24.839118,10,8

Tone: Professionalism: resume is polished and well-structured with consistent headings, clear contact info, and correct grammar. Action-Oriented: uses strong action verbs and quantifiable outcomes throughout (e.g., automated a sentiment pipeline processing 1M+ records, delivered 5× faster feedback loops, fine-tuned models improving accuracy ~5% and reducing toxicity ~8%, reduced time-to-apply by 60% and increased applications 300%, 96% cohort graduation rate). Persona Alignment: tightly tailored to cloud/ML/AI roles with comprehensive AWS/Azure services listed (Bedrock, SageMaker, Glue, Athena), generative-AI work (RAG, GPT-4.1 mini, pgvector), CI/CD and security experience—very well matched to a solutions architect/data-science persona. Minor shortcoming: core competencies section is long and slightly repetitive and could be tightened for concision.
Alignment: Mostly misaligned with the job posting. Strengths: candidate has a relevant Bachelor’s degree, Agile/Scrum and SDLC experience, and measurable technical outcomes (pipeline performance, model improvements). Partial matches: general documentation/communication skills appear but are technical rather than BA-focused. Major gaps: no 8+ years of Business Analysis or Sr Business Analyst title, no explicit experience with requirements gathering, JAD, design/requirements documents, mock-ups, Product Owner/user stories, acceptance criteria/test data, or traceability to business success criteria. Domain-specific preferences (Human Services, State government, SACWIS) are absent. Microsoft Office proficiency is not shown. Resume is technology-centric and generic rather than tailored to the role, so it fails to address several high-priority, measurable BA responsibilities.
Impact: I evaluated ~31 resume bullets against the rubric. Strengths: several bullets provide explicit actions plus measurable outcomes (e.g., ‘Automated sentiment pipeline processing 1M+ records with 5× faster feedback loops’, ‘Fine-tuned models improving accuracy ~5% and reducing toxicity ~8%’, Alfred project metrics: 60% time reduction and 300% increase in weekly applications, instructor metrics: 36 lessons for 200+ learners and 96% graduation rate, refurbishing 800+ devices). These bullets scored high for clear action and concrete metrics. Shortcomings: many bullets (e.g., “Designed and presented secure, scalable AWS reference architectures”, “Built POCs combining Bedrock…”, and multiple WOPLLI/Mayor’s Office items) lack measurable results or use non-actionable phrasing, so they scored mid-to-low. I applied penalties for passive/vague phrasing across several bullets (multiple bullets lost 2–4 points each), which pulled the average down. Comparing bullets, the metric-rich project and internship items drove the score up while generic design/configuration bullets and monitoring/support bullets drove it down. The final numeric rating is the normalized average of individual bullet scores reflecting that mix of strong measurable achievements and a substantial number of vague or metric-less bullets.
CredTail: Ground truth (from Retrieval Context): Degrees — M.S. Data Science & Machine Learning, CUNY SPS (Expected Jan 2026); B.Tech Computer Information Systems, CUNY NYC College of Technology (Jun 2024). Employers & dates — AWS (Solutions Architect Intern, Jun 2025–Sep 2025); WOPLLI Technologies (Software Developer Intern, Jun 2024–Sep 2024); Mayor’s Office of Information Services (IT Support Intern, Feb 2024–May 2024); RF CUNY & Generation USA (IT Instructor Assistant, Feb 2022–Aug 2023). Core technologies — Python (pandas, scikit-learn, seaborn, PyTorch), SQL/NoSQL, AWS (EC2, S3, Lambda, RDS, DynamoDB, Glue, QuickSight, Bedrock, Macie, SageMaker), Azure (App Service, Functions, Storage), FastAPI, PostgreSQL+pgvector, OpenAI GPT-4.1 mini, Docker, CI/CD, etc. Comparison: Each claimed degree, employer, employment dates, and listed core technologies in the Actual Output are Exact Matches to the Retrieval Context (titles, dates, institutions, project tech stacks align). No items are Missing or Fabricated; only trivial formatting/typo differences exist (e.g., minor naming/spacing variations like “Postgre” vs explicit “PostgreSQL” in artifacts). Penalties: none applied. Final score rationale: complete alignment and accurate details with full coverage of the verified facts from the Retrieval Context, so the highest credibility score is warranted.",68,2025-12-18 18:58:52.776948,6,10

Tone: Professionalism: highly professional tone, clear formatting, and error-free grammar across sections (contact, summary, certs, education, experience, projects). Action-Oriented: consistently uses strong verbs and provides multiple quantified impacts (e.g., 1M feedback records, 5× faster turnaround, 5% accuracy gain, 8% reduction in toxicity, 60% time reduction, 300% increase in applications, 96% cohort graduation). Persona Alignment: closely matches a Solutions Architect/Generative AI early-career persona with relevant cloud, ML, and project experience, though the summary’s phrase 'extensive experience' slightly overstates an otherwise internship-heavy background. Calculated category average is 4.7/5 and no two category scores differ by more than one, showing internal consistency.
Alignment: Responsibilities: Partially matched — resume demonstrates AWS architecture design, go-to-market collaboration, and generic contact-center experience (professional summary, AWS Solutions Architect intern) but lacks role-specific Amazon Connect, WFM, CRM, and partner-management duties. Tools/technologies: Limited match — strong AWS service coverage (Bedrock, SageMaker, Glue, QuickSight, Lambda, etc.) aligns with the employer’s AWS focus, but Amazon Connect and WFM/CRM platforms are not mentioned. Outcomes/metrics: Well demonstrated — multiple measurable results tied to projects (1M+ records processed, 5× faster feedback-to-action, 5% accuracy gain, 8% toxicity reduction, 60% time reduction, 300% more applications, 96% graduation), supporting impact claims. Penalization: Applied — resume reads more like an AWS intern/generalist and omits senior specialist/partner-specific language and Amazon Connect/WFM/CRM details, so a 3-point penalty is used. Weighted totals produce a low overall alignment.
Impact: The output contains multiple explicit, action-oriented accomplishments with clear numeric metrics (e.g., automated sentiment pipeline processing over 1M records and enabling 5× faster feedback-to-action; fine-tuning in SageMaker with a 5% accuracy gain and 8% reduction in toxicity/hallucinations; Alfred project reducing application time by 60% and increasing completed applications by 300%; 96% cohort graduation rate). These are specific, measurable results tied to business or operational outcomes, earning a high rating. Minor shortcomings: a few bullets lack baseline/context for the metrics and some phrasing is slightly vague/passive, so a small penalty is applied.
CredTail: Most claims are directly supported by the retrieval context: personal info, both degrees (MS expected Jan 2026 with GPA 4.0; B.Tech Jun 2024 with GPA 3.78), all listed internships and dates (AWS Jun 2025–Sep 2025; WOPLLI Jun 2024–Sep 2024; Mayor’s Office Feb 2024–May 2024; RF CUNY Feb 2022–Aug 2023), project details (Alfred with FastAPI, PostgreSQL+pgvector, OpenAI GPT-4.1 mini, Docker, CI/CD) and the AWS/core technology stack (EC2, S3, Lambda, Glue, QuickSight, Bedrock, SageMaker, etc.) all match the retrieval context. Shortcomings: the resume claims “Dean’s List (8x)” for the bachelor’s degree while the retrieval shows Dean’s List (5x) (contradiction), and it lists Tableau as a visualization skill which does not appear in the retrieval context (fabricated technology). These minor fabrications/contradictions reduce credibility but the rest of the output is well supported, so the score reflects a largely accurate but slightly overstated profile.",94,2025-12-18 19:09:39.792026,8,8

Tone: Professionalism 5/5 — resume is consistently formal, well-structured, and industry-appropriate with no notable errors. Action-Oriented 5/5 — frequent strong verbs and quantified outcomes (e.g., automated pipeline processing 1M+ records, 5× faster feedback loops, ~5% accuracy improvement, ~8% toxicity reduction, 96% cohort graduation rate). Persona Alignment 5/5 — tone and content clearly match a solutions-architect/data-science early-career candidate (AWS, Bedrock/SageMaker, FastAPI, .NET). Numeric average = (5+5+5)/3 = 5.0; highest = lowest = 5, so all aspects are equally strong. Overall alignment is excellent with no major shortcomings identified.
Alignment: Following the evaluation steps, I extracted core requirements: 8+ years hands-on Solutions Architect experience; lead automation in accounting vertical; strong .NET, API development, custom application design skills; provide technical oversight and guide/step-in to develop with a team; strong communication. Comparison to the resume: .NET (listed in Core Skills) — direct match; API development (REST, FastAPI) — direct match; Custom application design — direct match; Automation/CI-CD and AWS architecture experience (EC2, Lambda, S3, RDS, Bedrock/SageMaker POCs) — direct match with quantified outcomes (1M+ records, 5× faster feedback, ~5%/8% model improvements); Postman and other named tools — direct mentions. Shortcomings: no evidence of 8 years of experience (only internships and recent degrees) — missing; no accounting vertical/domain experience or examples of accounting automation — missing; lack of clear leadership/technical oversight of engineering teams or senior architect role responsibilities (no team lead/architect tenure) — missing; limited evidence of .NET applied in projects (skill listed but not shown in experience) — close paraphrase but weaker. Specificity: resume includes measurable internship POCs (positive), but these are junior-level and not tied to the requested senior/architect responsibilities. Overall match rate is low for seniority and domain/leadership requirements despite solid tool/skill overlap and some quantified outcomes, so the combined assessment yields a low score.
Impact: Strong presence of action verbs with multiple specific metrics: e.g., “Automated a sentiment-analysis pipeline processing 1M+ records” and “5× faster feedback loops,” plus model improvements (~5% accuracy, ~8% toxicity reduction), 100+ support tickets, 36 lessons for 200+ learners, and a 96% graduation rate. These outcomes show clear efficiency and quality impact. Shortcomings: several bullets are vague or lack measurable results (e.g., “Designed and presented secure, scalable AWS reference architectures,” “Built POCs,” WOPLLI items and some support/management bullets), and a few metrics lack explicit baselines or timeframes. Overall strong quantification and business relevance but diminished slightly by repeated non‑quantified/ambiguous bullets.

Two claimed items are not explicitly listed in the structured core_skills: “Custom Application Design” and “Communication & Collaboration” → MISSING (2/11 → raw proportion verified ≈ 9/11 → core subscore ≈ 8). No CONTRADICTIONS found. Per instructions, missing claims are treated as fabrications for penalty purposes; I list the missing items explicitly: Custom Application Design; Communication & Collaboration. Aggregate subscores (10, 10, 8) average to ~9.3; applying a strong penalty for the missing core-skill claims yields a conservative final credibility score of 8. The rating is driven upward by fully verified education and experience and reduced by the two unverified core-skill claims.",109,2025-12-18 19:10:02.063636,8,8

Tone: Following the evaluation steps, the resume scores very highly on professionalism (clean, consistent formatting, headings, correct grammar, no casual language), on action-orientation (frequent strong verbs like Designed/Built/Automated/Fine-tuned and multiple quantified impacts such as 1M+ records processed, 5× faster feedback loops, accuracy +5% and toxicity −8%, 60% time reduction / 300% application increase), and on persona alignment (strong match to solutions-architect/data/ML roles with extensive AWS/SageMaker/Bedrock/Glue/QuickSight experience, LLM and CI/CD skills, and relevant internship/project history). These strengths across the three evaluation categories yield an average at the top end of the scale.
Alignment: Following the evaluation steps, the resume rates ~65% overall: strong Exact matches for API development and custom application design plus hands‑on development and measurable automation outcomes (e.g., 1M+ records processed, 5× faster feedback, CI/CD), Partial matches for planning/design/technical oversight and team leadership, and Missing critical .NET expertise, accounting‑vertical experience, and the requested senior (8‑year) level; no strong generic‑content penalty applied.
Impact: Strong active ownership (many action verbs: Designed, Built, Automated, Fine-tuned, Implemented, Reduced, Boosted) and multiple concrete tasks across roles. Clear measurable results present: processing 1M+ records, 5× faster feedback loops, ~5% accuracy improvement and ~8% toxicity reduction, 60% time reduction and 300% increase in weekly applications, 800+ devices refurbished, 96% cohort graduation — all tied to operational/model/user outcomes. Minor shortcoming: several improvement metrics lack explicit baselines or timeframes for context (e.g., the ~5% accuracy gain), preventing a perfect top score.
CredTail: All claimed items in the Actual Output (degrees, employers, employment dates, and core technologies) match entries in the Retrieval Context.

Tone: Professionalism: strong formal resume tone, clear layout and grammar, consistent formatting across sections (header, summary, skills, experience). Action-Oriented: uses strong verbs and measurable outcomes (e.g., “Automated a sentiment-analysis pipeline processing 1M+ records,” “5× faster feedback loops,” “improving accuracy by ~5% and reducing toxicity by ~8%”). Persona Alignment: excellent match to cloud/solutions architect and data roles—AWS services, Bedrock/SageMaker, CI/CD, microservices and relevant certifications are emphasized. All three categories scored equally, so no category is ≥1 point lower than the highest; overall average scaled to the requested range.
Alignment: Following the steps I extracted 10 key requirements (hands-on SA, 8 years exp, lead automation in accounting, .NET, API dev, custom app design, technical oversight, team leadership, hands-on development, strong communication). The resume shows 3 explicit matches (.NET, API, hands-on development) and 4 implied matches (solutions-architect internship/certs, architecture/POCs, technical design experience, teaching/presentation evidence) for a 50% match, which maps to a base score of 5. I applied a -1 penalty for missing the required 8 years, no accounting-vertical leadership, and no demonstrated team-leading/architect-level ownership, and a +1 bonus for clear measurable outcomes (1M+ records processed, 5× faster feedback loops) and explicit use of required tools, yielding a final score of 5. Rationale (one line): The candidate demonstrates relevant tooling (.NET, API) and measurable automation outcomes but lacks the requested seniority, accounting-domain leadership, and team oversight demanded by the job.
Impact: Multiple explicit action verbs and measurable outcomes align with step 1: automated a sentiment pipeline processing 1M+ records, produced 5× faster feedback loops, fine-tuned models improving accuracy (~5%) and reducing toxicity (~8%), and delivered 36 lessons to 200+ learners. Language shows active ownership (designed, built, automated, fine-tuned) and ties results to business impact (real-time dashboards, faster feedback), so no major passive‑language penalties and step 4 supports an upward adjustment. Some earlier roles have fewer metrics but do not materially weaken the clear, quantified accomplishments above.

Core technologies largely match (Python, SQL, AWS services including Bedrock/Glue/SageMaker, QuickSight/Power BI, PostgreSQL/MySQL/Oracle/MongoDB); .NET appears in the Actual Output while it is not explicitly listed in the structured core_skills array (partial match, though .NET is present in the artifact text). No fabricated items detected. The only notable omission is the projects section (e.g., the “Alfred” project) from the Actual Output.

Action-Oriented 4/5 — many strong action verbs and quantified accomplishments (1M+ records, 5x faster feedback loops, 5% accuracy gain, 8% toxicity reduction, 60% time reduction, 300% increase in applications, 96% graduation), but several bullets remain vague (e.g., “enhancing security and scalability,” “reducing manual workload significantly”) and could use more specific metrics. Persona Alignment 5/5 — excellent fit for cloud/ML/solutions-architect roles (AWS/SageMaker/Bedrock, relevant certifications, ML project Alfred). Largest gap is 1 point between Professionalism and Action-Oriented, which is consistent (strong presentation but a few missing quantifications). Average of the three subscores = 4.7/5.
Alignment: The resume shows strong measurable outcomes (processing 1M+ records, 5x faster feedback loops, +5% model accuracy, -8% toxicity; Alfred: -60% application time, +300% applications, 96% course graduation) — merits full points for metrics. It lists many AWS services (EC2, S3, Lambda, RDS, DynamoDB, Glue, QuickSight, Bedrock, SageMaker) so partial tools match, but it omits critical must-haves from the JD: Amazon Connect, Contact Center/WFM, CRM integrations, and AWS WWSO Apps. Responsibility alignment is weak: no evidence of go-to-market/partner ownership or senior specialist-level experience (role is intern-level). Scoring: Responsibility 0/3, Tools 1/3, Outcomes 3/3 = 4; minus 2 for lack of senior/domain-specific tailoring and missing must-have technologies → final score 2.
Impact: The output consistently uses strong action verbs with measurable results and clear business outcomes across multiple bullets (e.g., “Built automated sentiment analysis pipeline processing 1M+ records, achieving 5x faster feedback loops”; “Fine-tuned models… improving accuracy by 5% and reducing toxicity by 8%”; “Delivered 36 lessons to 200+ learners, achieving a 96% graduation rate”; project claims of 60% time reduction and 300% more applications). Metric quality is high (precise counts, percentages, multiplicative gains). Minor vagueness appears in a few lines (e.g., “enhancing security and scalability,” “reducing manual workload significantly,” “supporting secure user access” without metrics), warranting only a small penalty, but overall the content meets the action+metric+outcome criteria and uses specific metrics and business impact.
CredTail: Strong alignment overall: degrees (MS Data Science & ML expected Jan 2026 with GPA 4.0; B.Tech Computer Information Systems Jun 2024, GPA 3.78) and employers with employment dates (AWS Solutions Architect Intern Jun 2025–Sep 2025; WOPLLI Software Dev Intern Jun 2024–Sep 2024; Mayor’s Office IT Support Feb 2024–May 2024; RF CUNY & Generation USA IT Instructor Assistant Feb 2022–Aug 2023) are exact matches to the Retrieval Context. Core technologies largely match (AWS services such as EC2/S3/Lambda/RDS/DynamoDB/Glue/QuickSight/Bedrock and SageMaker; FastAPI, OpenAI GPT-4.1, Docker, Git, Python, SQL/NoSQL, SIEM/Active Directory); project claims (Alfred: FastAPI + OpenAI GPT-4.1; 60% time reduction, 300% application increase) are supported by the artifacts. Minor discrepancies: two core technologies present in the Retrieval Context are not explicitly listed in the Actual Output (Macie; PostgreSQL + pgvector in the Alfred project) — per the evaluation rules these count as missing core technologies. Additional small inconsistencies (Actual omits the Retrieval’s “Google Information Support Certificate” and shows different Dean’s List counts than the Retrieval Context) are noted but lower priority. No direct contradictions or suspected fabrications were found. Evidence summary for penalized items: exact matches (degrees, employers, dates, major AWS/SageMaker/Bedrock/Glue/QuickSight items, FastAPI/GPT-4.1 project metrics), partial/omitted matches (Azure subcomponents and some honor-count differences), missing core technologies (Macie; PostgreSQL + pgvector). Recommendation: verify the two omitted core technologies and the omitted Google certificate with source documents. Score adjusted by deducting two points for each missing core technology per the evaluation rules, and leaving the rest intact.",84,2025-12-18 19:11:25.627867,10,6
30,1045,P1,9.18918918918919,10,4,32.18918918918919,"Punctuality: The score is 0.92 because the actual output contains three clear mismatches with the retrieval: it states ""GPA: 3.8 | Expected Graduation: May 2024"" while the structured profile shows GPA 3.78 and Graduation Jun 2024; it lists the IT Support Intern role as ""February 2024 – Present"" though the profile indicates Feb 2024–May 2024; and it claims restoring ""over 400"" devices whereas the retrieval documents refurbishing/tracking over 800 devices.
Tone: Highly professional formatting, clear sections, and correct grammar support a top Professionalism rating. Bullets are action-driven with quantified achievements (restored 400 devices, 96% cohort graduation, 60% reduction in application time) and strong verbs (Developed, Implemented, Delivered), supporting a top Action-Oriented rating. Tone, emphasized skills (Business Analysis, Agile, Python/SQL, AWS), project relevance, and certifications align well with a technologist/business-analyst/data-science persona, supporting a top Persona Alignment rating; these combined produce the highest averaged evaluation.
Alignment: Step 1 extracted top priorities: interpret business rules/requirements, analyze Product Owner needs and user stories, ensure lifecycle/process adherence and traceability to measurable success criteria, work with customers/QA to develop test data and acceptance criteria; tools/qualifications: 8+ years BA, Bachelor’s in IT, Microsoft Office, JAD/design documents/mock-ups, 3+ years Agile, Human Services/state government and SACWIS preferred. Step 2 comparison: exact matches — Bachelor’s in IT, Microsoft Office, listed skills in requirement gathering, JAD, design documents/mock-ups, Agile/Scrum, and communication/documentation. Partial matches — user story creation claimed but no concrete examples or PO-facing deliverables; some measurable metrics (device restorations, 96% cohort, 60% application time reduction) exist but are not tied to BA responsibilities or lifecycle traceability. Missing — critical high-priority items: 8+ years of BA experience, Human Services/state government and SACWIS experience, explicit QA/test-data and acceptance-criteria work, and demonstrated traceability of requirements to measurable project success. The resume also uses some generic language and lacks role/company-specific achievements tied to required outcomes, justifying penalties. Overall shows basic skill alignment but misses multiple high-priority requirements.
Impact: I scored each resume bullet for explicit action + measurable outcome per step 1, awarded higher marks where concrete metrics appear (e.g., “restore over 400 devices,” “36 lessons” with a “96% cohort graduation rate,” and “reducing application time by 60%” received the highest individual marks). Bullets that state clear accomplishments but lack metrics (FastAPI automating resumes; testing materials) received mid scores. Several bullets use vague/non-actionable phrasing (e.g., “Provide support…,” “Communicate effectively…,” “Collaborated…to enhance…”) and were penalized per step 3, reducing their scores. I averaged the adjusted bullet scores and normalized to a 1–10 scale as required; strong metric-driven bullets (400 devices, 96% graduation, 60% reduction) drove the rating up, while multiple vague/passive bullets pulled it down, yielding the final score.
CredTail: Ground truth (from Retrieval Context): Master of Science – Data Science & Machine Learning (CUNY SPS) Expected Jan 2026; Bachelor of Technology – Computer Information Systems (CUNY NYC College of Technology) Jun 2024, GPA ~3.78; Experience: IT Instructor Assistant (RF CUNY & Generation USA) Feb 2022–Aug 2023; IT Support Intern, Mayor’s Office of Information Services Feb 2024–May 2024; Software Developer Intern (WOPLLI) Jun 2024–Sep 2024; Solutions Architect Intern (AWS) Jun 2025–Sep 2025; Project “Alfred” with FastAPI, PostgreSQL+pgvector, OpenAI GPT-4.1 mini, Docker, CI/CD, RAG; Core tech includes detailed AWS services (EC2,S3,Lambda,Glue,QuickSight,Bedrock,SageMaker), Python (pandas,scikit-learn,PyTorch), SQL/NoSQL, Docker, FastAPI, etc.; Certifications: AWS Solutions Architect Associate, AWS AI Practitioner (Generative AI), Google Cybersecurity, Google Information Support. Comparison and deductions: - Education: Master matches exactly (no penalty). Bachelor degree/institution match but small discrepancies in GPA (3.8 vs 3.78) and graduation month (May vs Jun 2024) — marked Partial (minor; -0.5). - Certifications: Exact match (no penalty). - Projects: Alfred present and largely accurate but omits PostgreSQL+pgvector, Docker, CI/CD and specific LLM version details (Partial/Missing; -0.5). - Core technologies: Actual lists Python, SQL, AWS, QuickSight, Power BI and Agile (Exact/Partial), but omits many core items from retrieval (EC2, S3, Lambda, Glue, Bedrock, SageMaker, PyTorch, PostgreSQL, pgvector, Docker, etc.) — Multiple Missing items (aggregate -2). - Experience: IT Instructor Assistant is an Exact Match. Mayor’s Office entry is inconsistent: retrieval shows IT Support Intern Feb–May 2024 with ~800 devices refurbished; Actual lists “Volunteer IT Support and Development Intern” Feb 2024–Present and “restored over 400 devices” — treated as Fabricated/Contradiction (incorrect end date and device count) (-2). - Missing experiences: Actual omits two major internships from retrieval (WOPLLI Jun–Sep 2024 and AWS Solutions Architect Intern Jun–Sep 2025) — significant Missing items (-2). Overall assessment: the résumé content aligns on high-level education, one internship, project and certifications, but has significant missing employment entries and many omitted technical specifics plus one contradictory internship date/metrics. Applying proportional penalties yields a credibility score reflecting significant but not wholesale mismatch.",71,2025-12-18 18:59:15.427441,5,4
52,1363,P3,10,10,10,47,"Punctuality: The score is 1.00 because the contradictions list is empty, indicating no discrepancies were found and the actual output fully aligns with the retrieval context — nice work!
Tone: Professionalism: strong formal tone, clean grammar, and appropriate vocabulary (clear summary, formal headings). Action-Oriented: consistently uses action verbs and quantified impacts (e.g., automated pipeline processing over 1M records, 5× faster feedback-to-action, 5% accuracy improvement, 8% toxicity reduction, Alfred project: 60% time reduction and 300% increase in applications). Persona Alignment: well-matched to an AI/Data Scientist/Solutions Architect role with relevant AWS/Gens AI experience (Bedrock, SageMaker, Athena, Glue), certifications, and applicable tools (Python, SQL, PostgreSQL). Calculated category scores = 5 / 5 / 5, average = 5.0 (reported to one decimal). No category pair differs by more than 1, so assessments are consistent. Minor note: mixing “Solutions Architect” and “Data Scientist” language may slightly blur seniority focus, but overall alignment is strong.
Alignment: High alignment: All core responsibilities from the posting are demonstrated—improving AI intelligence/safety (fine-tuned models with an 8% toxicity reduction and 5% accuracy gain), delivering high-quality LLM data and pipelines (RAG/GPT-4.1 project, POC with Bedrock, automated sentiment pipeline processing >1M records with 5× faster turnaround). Tools/technologies from the JD’s LLM/Generative AI focus are present (AWS Bedrock, SageMaker, OpenAI GPT-4.1, RAG). Measurable outcomes/KPIs are provided and tied to responsibilities (1M records, 5× speedup, 5% accuracy, 8% toxicity reduction, 60% time reduction, 300% increase in applications). No generic-template penalty applied because the summary explicitly tailors the resume to Outlier AI and uses role-specific language, supporting a full score under the evaluation steps.
Impact: Strong presence of action-oriented, measurable accomplishments (e.g., sentiment pipeline processing over 1M records enabling 5× faster feedback-to-action; fine-tuning that yielded +5% accuracy and −8% toxicity; 96% cohort graduation; project metrics showing 60% reduced application time and 300% more weekly applications). These demonstrate clear, quantifiable business impact. Minor shortcomings: a few bullets use passive phrasing or omit numeric context (e.g., “reduced manual workload” without a metric), so slight penalty for inconsistent metric coverage and some vague descriptions.
CredTail: Most claims are directly supported by the Retrieval Context: both degrees (MS Data Science & Machine Learning, expected Jan 2026, GPA 4.0; B.Tech Computer Information Systems, Jun 2024, GPA 3.78, Dean’s List 5x, National Honor Society), certifications (AWS Solutions Architect, AWS AI Practitioner, Google Cybersecurity), internships (AWS Jun 2025–Sep 2025; WOPLLI Jun 2024–Sep 2024; Mayor’s Office Feb 2024–May 2024; RF CUNY & Generation Feb 2022–Aug 2023), and the Alfred project/tech (FastAPI, PostgreSQL/pgvector, GPT-4.1 mini/RAG) all appear in the Retrieval Context. Deductions made for unsupported/fabricated items: the mention of “Outlier AI” in the summary is not in the context; core skills list adds Java, JavaScript, and Tableau which are not present in the context; language claims (English/Spanish) are not found in the Retrieval Context. These minor fabrications/omissions reduce credibility but most key items are verified.",103,2025-12-18 19:12:06.536064,9,8

Tone: Professionalism: 5 — the resume uses a consistently formal, industry-appropriate tone with no obvious errors and clear headings (contact info, summary, skills, education). Action-Oriented: 5 — frequent strong action verbs (Designed, Built, Automated, Fine-tuned) with quantified outcomes (processed 1M+ records, 5× faster feedback loops, ~5% accuracy gain, ~8% toxicity reduction, 96% cohort graduation rate). Persona Alignment: 5 — tone and content strongly match a cloud/AI solutions architect or data/ML practitioner (AWS services, Bedrock, SageMaker, QuickSight) and the candidate persona (early-career internship experience progressing toward an MS). Average score: 5.0 (highest=Professionalism/Action-Oriented/Persona Alignment all equal; no notable discrepancies).
Alignment: Extracted requirements: 8+ years software engineering/architecture, .NET, API development, custom application design, lead automation in accounting vertical, provide technical oversight across planning/design/development, guide a team but be hands-on, strong communication. Matches: .NET is listed in Core Skills (direct match) and APIs (REST, FastAPI, Postman, Swagger) and automation/CI-CD (GitHub Actions, Docker) and strong cloud/architecture experience and AWS certifications (direct matches). Paraphrases/partial: leadership claims and teaching experience suggest team guidance (close paraphrase) and hands-on development shown in internships/projects (partial). Missing or weak: no evidence of 8 years of experience (major gap), no accounting-vertical domain experience mentioned (missing), no concrete .NET project or senior technical oversight of engineering teams end-to-end (missing/weak). Specificity: resume shows good quantified AWS project outcomes (1M+ records, 5× faster feedback loops, ~5% accuracy gain) which supports automation/architecture skills. Overall, while tools and some responsibilities align, the lack of required senior experience, accounting domain background, and explicit senior oversight/production .NET work are significant mismatches, so the resume rates low for this senior Solutions Architect role.
Impact: Strong alignment: Many bullets use active verbs with specific metrics — e.g., “Automated a sentiment-analysis pipeline processing 1M+ records” with “5× faster feedback loops,” model fine-tuning yielding “~5%” accuracy gain and “~8%” toxicity reduction, “36 lessons” for “200+ learners,” “96% cohort graduation rate,” and “over 100 tickets.” These are quantifiable and tied to scale, efficiency, and outcomes. Deductions: several bullets are vague or passive (e.g., “Designed and presented secure, scalable AWS reference architectures,” “Managed relations with 3rd‑party vendors,” “Automated troubleshooting workflows…to reduce manual workload” without a percent/timeframe), reducing clarity and business impact in places. Overall multiple distinct, relevant metrics earn a high score but not perfect due to recurring non‑measurable language.
CredTail: Step 1 (claim verification): Education and Experience claims are VERIFIED — both degrees (M.S. Data Science & Machine Learning, expected Jan 2026; B.Tech CIS, Jun 2024) and all four roles (AWS Solutions Architect Intern Jun 2025–Sep 2025; Software Developer Intern WOPLLI Jun 2024–Sep 2024; IT Support Intern Feb 2024–May 2024; IT Instructor Assistant Feb 2022–Aug 2023) with matching highlights/dates appear in the Retrieval Context. Core Skills: most technology claims are VERIFIED (AWS services, Glue, QuickSight, SageMaker/Bedrock, FastAPI, Postgres/Oracle/MySQL/MongoDB/DynamoDB, Docker, GitHub Actions, REST/Postman/Swagger), but several programming-language items are MISSING from the Retrieval Context (JavaScript, HTML, PHP). The explicit soft-skills line (“Excellent verbal and written communication, collaboration, customer service”) is not evidenced and treated as unverifiable/missing. Step 2 (subscores): Education = full verification (10/10). Experience = full verification (10/10). Core Skills initial proportion verified = 25 verified out of 31 discrete claims (~8/10). Step 3 (fabrication penalty): applied a strong penalty to Core Skills for missing language claims and unverifiable soft-skills — fabricated/missing items explicitly: JavaScript; HTML; PHP; explicit “Excellent verbal and written communication / collaboration / customer service” line. Step 4 (aggregation & determination): final credibility reflects near-complete alignment for Education and Experience but a reduced Core Skills subscore due to the listed missing items; the missing web-language claims and unverifiable soft-skills were the primary factors driving the penalty and final rating.",119,2025-12-18 19:12:53.241591,9,8
54,1615,P2,9.6,7,6,31.6,"Punctuality: The score is 0.96 because the only contradiction is that the actual output lists the role as 'Volunteer' and shows the position as ongoing ('02/2024 – Current'), while the retrieval states the candidate served as IT Support Intern at the Mayor's Office of Information Services, New York, NY from Feb 2024 to May 2024 — a single role/date mismatch that justifies a small deduction.
Tone: Professionalism is strong: clear headings, consistent formatting, and generally correct grammar with minor issues (e.g., “Honor's Society” typo and small punctuation inconsistencies). Action-oriented content is weaker — many bullets describe duties rather than measurable results, though there are good metrics in places (taught 36 lessons; generated reports from 65,000+ records). Persona alignment is good: relevant .NET, microservices, databases, CI/CD, and AWS/Google certifications plus related projects and education fit a software/engineering technologist role. Note an imbalance: Action-Oriented is about one point lower than the top categories, so refocusing bullets toward quantified outcomes would improve the overall rating.
Alignment: Extracted requirements: 8 years software engineering/architecture; lead automation in accounting; .NET; API development; custom application design; technical oversight across planning/design/development; guide a team of engineers; hands-on development; strong communication. Actual output: .NET and API are explicit; hands-on development and automation/CI-CD are explicit; custom app design, SDLC/oversight, team leadership, and communication are only implied; 8 years experience and accounting-domain experience are absent (projects mainly PHP/MySQL, internship/teaching roles). Match = (3 explicit + 0.5*4 implied) / 9 ≈ 55.6%, placing it in the 50–74% band. Applied a -1 penalty for generic/ignoring the seniority and domain specifics and a +1 bonus for explicit required tools; final score returned accordingly.
Impact: Assigned a mid-range score because the resume contains clear action verbs and measurable details (e.g., taught 36 lessons, generated reports from a 65,000+ record database, GPA 3.8, listed certifications) which supports tangible accomplishments. However many bullets are generic or passive (“Provide support,” “Assist,” “Participate”) and lack business-impact metrics or ownership, reducing clarity of outcomes. Projects show some business relevance (POS for a global rental agency), but overall insufficient quantification and ownership led to a penalty with a modest uplift for the concrete metrics present.
CredTail: Verified exact matches: name, email, phone, LinkedIn URL, location, IT Instructor Assistant employer/dates/highlights, and certifications. Partial matches: core technologies (several overlap like SDLC, Agile, OOP, PostgreSQL/MySQL/Oracle/MongoDB, Active Directory/Linux) but notable omissions of major retrieval tech (AWS services, Python, FastAPI, SageMaker, Bedrock, pgvector) and the Alfred project. Partial/incorrect education fields: Bachelor degree present but graduation month and GPA differ slightly (Actual shows May 2024 / 3.8 vs retrieval Jun 2024 / 3.78) and honors truncated. Major mismatches/fabrications: Mayor’s Office role date claimed as 02/2024–Current but retrieval shows Feb 2024–May 2024 (date overstated), and Actual lists projects (Financial Stocks Report, EzRental) not found in retrieval while omitting the documented Alfred project and paid internships (AWS Jun–Sep 2025, WOPLLI Jun–Sep 2024). Because multiple critical employer entries and project details are missing or fabricated and core tech is only a partial overlap, I applied substantial penalties to reflect inconsistent and incomplete alignment.",120,2025-12-18 19:13:45.247936,6,3

Tone: Professionalism: scored high for clear structure, consistent headings/bullets, correct grammar, and professional contact links (LinkedIn/GitHub) and no casual language. Action‑Oriented: strong use of action verbs (Designed, Built, Automated, Fine‑tuned) and many quantified outcomes (1M+ records, 5× faster feedback loops, ~5% accuracy gain, 60% time reduction, 300% application increase), showing results focus. Persona Alignment: excellent alignment with cloud/AI/solutions architect roles—detailed AWS services (Bedrock, SageMaker, Glue), generative AI work, architecture/POC descriptions, and relevant certifications/education that match the target industry and seniority. All three categories rated at top marks, average mapped to a 10 out of 10.
Alignment: Weighted match ≈65% → mapped to 7. Strengths: clear, concrete API and custom-app experience (FastAPI/REST/Postman/Swagger; Virtual Credential System, Alfred) and measurable outcomes (1M+ records processed, 5× faster feedback loops, 60% time reduction, model accuracy/toxicity gains). Partial matches: automation experience and some technical design/oversight (AWS architecture POCs, presentations). Major shortcomings: no .NET expertise, no accounting-vertical experience, no evidence of leading engineering teams or 8+ years seniority. Resume is specific with metrics, so no generic-content penalty applied.
Impact: Strong action-oriented language throughout (verbs like designed, built, automated, fine-tuned, integrated, developed, managed) demonstrating clear ownership. Multiple precise metrics are present: processing 1M+ records, 5× faster feedback loops, ~5% accuracy improvement, ~8% toxicity reduction, refurbished 800+ devices, 100+ tickets, 96% graduation rate, 60% reduction in time-to-apply and 300% increase in weekly applications — giving concrete evidence of impact. Business outcomes are tied to efficiency, quality, and adoption (faster feedback loops, model quality improvements, increased application throughput), though dollar/ROI or explicit baseline timeframes are generally absent. Passive phrasing is minimal. Overall the output scores very highly on action, measurable results, and strategic impact but lacks explicit financial or baseline context in some metrics.
CredTail: All claims in the Actual Output match entries in the Retrieval Context. Degrees: Master of Science (Data Science & ML — CUNY SPS, Expected Jan 2026, GPA 4.0, Dean’s List 2x) and Bachelor of Technology (Computer Information Systems — NYC College of Technology, Jun 2024, GPA 3.78, Dean’s List 5x, National Honor Society) are Verified.

Tone: Professionalism rated 5/5 — clear, well-formatted resume, correct grammar, consistent headings and bullets. Action-Oriented rated 5/5 — uses strong action verbs and includes multiple quantified impacts (e.g., 1M+ records, 5x faster, 5% accuracy improvement, 8% toxicity reduction, 60% time reduction). Persona Alignment rated 5/5 — excellent fit for cloud/ML/AI roles with relevant certifications, AWS/SageMaker/Bedrock skills, and aligned projects. Scores are consistent with no notable gap; average = 5.0/5. Minor improvement: add brief context for some metrics (team size or baseline) and ensure timeline clarity for internships/projects.
Alignment: The resume shows relevant AWS experience and several concrete metrics (e.g., “1M+ records”, “5x faster feedback”, 5% accuracy gain, 8% toxicity reduction, 60% time reduction, 96% graduation rate), so measurable outcomes are present and core AWS tooling (SageMaker, Bedrock, Glue, EC2, S3, Lambda, RDS, DynamoDB, QuickSight) is listed. However it fails to explicitly match critical JD responsibilities: no mention of Amazon Connect, Contact Center solutions, WFM, CRM, or AWS WWSO Apps and no evidence of go-to-market or partner organization experience (critical items), so responsibility match is essentially nil. Tools match is partial (many general AWS services present) but misses must-have contact-center/CRM tech. The document is also junior/intern-level rather than a senior specialist role, so I subtract points for lack of tailoring to the Senior WW Specialist Solutions Architect requirements.
Impact: The resume contains multiple examples with an action verb, measurable result, and clear business outcome (e.g., built a sentiment pipeline processing 1M+ records enabling 5x faster feedback; fine‑tuned SageMaker models +5% accuracy / -8% toxicity; developed a job assistant reducing application time by 60%; delivered 36 lessons to 200+ learners with a 96% graduation rate). Metric specificity is strong (absolute counts, percentages, multiplicative speedup). Minor weaknesses are a few vague bullets without metrics or concrete impact (e.g., “designed secure, scalable architectures,” “automated… reducing manual workload significantly”), which warrants a small clarity penalty, but overall the output demonstrates high-impact, measurable accomplishments with good business relevance.
CredTail: High overall alignment: name, location, contact info, LinkedIn/GitHub, both degrees (CUNY SPS MS expected Jan 2026, CUNY City Tech B.Tech Jun 2024) and GPAs, employers and employment dates (AWS Jun 2025–Sep 2025; WOPLLI Jun 2024–Sep 2024; Mayor’s Office Feb 2024–May 2024; RF CUNY/Generation Feb 2022–Aug 2023), project “Alfred” (FastAPI, PostgreSQL/pgvector, OpenAI GPT-4.1 cohort) and many AWS technologies (Bedrock, SageMaker, Glue, QuickSight) are exact matches to the Retrieval Context. Partial matches: project model label (Actual lists GPT-4.1 vs Retrieval’s GPT-4.1 mini) and Azure is cited but not the same service-level specifics. Missing / discrepant items: Actual omits the “Google Information Support Certificate” present in Retrieval; Retrieval lists Macie, Power BI, R Programming, Oracle/MySQL/MongoDB, and Postman which are not enumerated in the Actual Output (missing core technologies). Minor contradiction: Actual lists “Dean’s List (8x)” while Retrieval shows Dean’s List counts of 5x (Bach.) + 2x (MS) = 7x. Deductions applied for the dean’s-list count discrepancy and omitted certification/selected core technologies yield the score. Recommend source verification for the Dean’s List tally, the omitted Google certificate, and the missing core technologies (Macie, Power BI, R, Oracle/MySQL/MongoDB, Postman) before trusting penalized items.",96,2025-12-18 19:14:09.919191,10,8

Tone: Professionalism 4/5 — clean, consistent formatting and good grammar with clear sections (Education with GPA 3.8 and Expected Graduation May 2024; Certifications list includes AWS). Action-Oriented 3/5 — some strong verbs (Provide, Assist, Taught, Led) but most bullets are generic, include passive constructions, and lack quantified outcomes. Persona Alignment 3/5 — relevant IT signals (Computer Information Systems degree, Mayor’s Office internship, AWS certs, helpdesk/dev experience) but missing concrete technical details (tools, languages, metrics) that hiring managers expect. Average ≈3.33/5, resulting in a mid-high overall rating on the 0–10 scale.
Alignment: The resume shows a few relevant skills (explicitly lists requirement gathering, Agile/Scrum, Microsoft Office proficiency and communication/documentation skills) and a related degree (Bachelor of Technology in Computer Information Systems, though marked as expected May 2024) — these are partial matches to the job’s tool/skill requirements. However, it fails on high-priority items: no 8+ years of Business Analysis experience or Sr. BA title, no concrete examples of interpreting business rules, writing user stories/Product Owner artifacts, creating JAD/design/requirements documents or mock-ups, and no collaboration with QA on test data/acceptance criteria. Preferred domain experience (Human Services/State government and SACWIS) is entirely missing. Measurable outcomes are sparse or vague (e.g., “high cohort graduation rate” without metrics). Language is largely non-tailored and generic rather than role-specific. Overall, a few low- to mid-priority matches but multiple critical gaps and lack of measurable achievements.
Impact: I evaluated 7 resume bullets for explicit action + measurable outcome and penalized vague/passive wording. Most bullets (e.g., “Provide support…”, “Assist in providing white glove service…”, “Communicate with team members…”) describe activities but lack measurable results and were downgraded for non-actionable phrasing. “Participate in a project to restore out-of-commission devices…” is comparatively stronger (implied result), and “Achieved a high cohort graduation rate” shows impact but is vague without a numeric. Concrete positives: GPA 3.8, Expected Graduation May 2024, and two AWS certifications. Overall, missing metrics and imprecise language across bullets drove the low aggregated score.
CredTail: Ground truth (from Retrieval Context): Bachelor of Technology — Computer Information Systems, NYC College of Technology (Jun 2024, GPA 3.78); Master of Science — Data Science & Machine Learning, CUNY SPS (expected Jan 2026, GPA 4.0); employers and dates: AWS (Solutions Architect Intern, Jun 2025–Sep 2025), WOPLLI Technologies (Software Developer Intern, Jun 2024–Sep 2024), Mayor’s Office of Information Services (IT Support Intern, Feb 2024–May 2024), RF CUNY & Generation USA (IT Instructor Assistant, Feb 2022–Aug 2023); core technologies include Python (pandas, PyTorch), SQL/NoSQL, AWS services (EC2,S3,Lambda,RDS,DynamoDB,Glue,QuickSight,Bedrock,SageMaker), Azure, Docker, CI/CD, ML, etc.; certifications include the two AWS certs. Comparison to Actual Output: Bachelor — Partial Match (Actual lists same degree/institution but Expected/Graduation date May 2024 and GPA rounded to 3.8 vs 3.78); Master — Missing from Actual Output; Mayor’s Office — Employer present but date extended to “Feb 2024 – Current” (Fabricated/contradicted by Retrieval’s Feb 2024–May 2024); IT Instructor Assistant — Exact Match (Feb 2022–Aug 2023); AWS (Jun 2025) and WOPLLI (Jun–Sep 2024) internships — Missing from Actual Output; core technologies from Retrieval are largely omitted in Actual Output (Missing); certifications — Exact Match. Penalties applied: Missing Master’s (–2), Missing AWS internship (–1.5), Missing WOPLLI internship (–1), Fabricated Mayor’s Office end date (–0.5), Missing core technologies (–1) — total deductions –6 from perfect alignment.

Tone: Professionalism: strong — formal tone, clean grammar, well-structured sections and formatting. Action-oriented: strong — uses active verbs and quantifies impact (e.g., 1M+ records, 5× faster, ~5% accuracy gain, ~8% toxicity reduction, 300% application lift). Persona alignment: weak — résumé claims “Solutions Architect with over 8 years” but evidence shows recent degrees and internship roles (B.Tech Jun 2024, internships 2024–2025), creating a seniority mismatch. Average of category ratings results in an overall high score but flags inconsistency because two category scores differ by more than 1.
Alignment: Strengths: The resume explicitly lists .NET, API development (FastAPI, Postman) and custom application work (project Alfred), and includes measurable automation outcomes (automated pipeline processing 1M+ records with 5× faster feedback loops; Alfred reduced time-to-apply by 60% and increased applications 300%). Weaknesses: It does not document the requested 8 years of continuous professional experience (work history shows internships from 2022–2025), has no evidence of accounting-vertical experience, and provides no clear examples of technical oversight or leading a team. Evaluation summary per steps: responsibilities matched ~50% (4 of 8), tools/platforms matched 100%, measurable outcomes partial (~50%); a 2-point penalty was applied for generic/misaligned tailoring, producing the final assessment.
Impact: The output contains numerous explicit, action-oriented results with clear metrics (e.g., automated pipeline processing 1M+ records; 5× faster feedback loops; ~5% accuracy gain and ~8% toxicity reduction in SageMaker; 60% time reduction and 300% increase in weekly applications; 96% cohort graduation rate; 100+ tickets supported). These provide strong, measurable business impact and use active verbs. Minor deductions were applied because a few items lack context or baselines (e.g., “designed and presented secure, scalable AWS reference architectures” and some intern tasks are unquantified), and a small number of claims are vague. Overall, the resume is highly metric-driven and business-focused.
CredTail: Most claims are directly supported by the retrieval context: both degrees (M.S. Data Science & Machine Learning, expected Jan 2026; B.Tech Computer Information Systems, Jun 2024) with GPAs and honors match; certifications match the listed four; all four employer entries and their dates (AWS Jun 2025–Sep 2025, WOPLLI Jun 2024–Sep 2024, Mayor’s Office Feb 2024–May 2024, RF CUNY & Generation USA Feb 2022–Aug 2023) and project details for Alfred (FastAPI + OpenAI GPT-4 mini, RAG, metrics) appear in the retrieval context; core AWS/Azure services, QuickSight/Power BI, Docker, APIs, ETL, security items, contact info, and LinkedIn are supported. Two minor unsupported items caused deductions: the résumé’s claim of “over 8 years of experience” is not stated in the retrieval context, and “JavaScript” is not listed among the core technologies in the provided context. Given mostly full support with these small omissions, the score reflects minor gaps rather than major fabrication.",114,2025-12-18 19:14:51.905423,9,8

Tone: Professionalism=5: consistently formal, well-structured, and largely error-free (clear headings, complete contact info, polished language). Action-Oriented=5: frequent strong verbs and quantified achievements (automated pipeline processing 1M+ records, 5× faster feedback loops, ~5% accuracy gain and ~8% toxicity reduction, 96% cohort graduation). Persona Alignment=5: tone and content clearly fit a cloud/data/ML early-career technologist (AWS services, Bedrock, Glue, SageMaker, internships and targeted skills). Average = (5+5+5)/3 = 5.0 → scaled score 10. Highest/Lowest: all aspects equal at the maximum, indicating balanced strengths across professionalism, action-orientation, and persona fit; no significant shortcomings identified in the provided output.
Alignment: Matches: Python and Java listed (direct match); cloud experience (AWS, Azure) and microservices/service-oriented patterns present (direct); communication and some leadership/mentoring claims (close paraphrase); concrete, quantified projects (1M+ records pipeline, 5× faster feedback loops, model accuracy +5%, toxicity -8%) show specificity. Missing or weak: no principal-level or long-term technical leadership for peers/IC4 expectations, no explicit experience with datacenter automation or physical-asset lifecycle, no control-plane/data-plane or large-scale distributed virtualized infrastructure experience, limited evidence of production ops at massive scale and performance troubleshooting. Count summary (approx.): ~3–4 direct matches, ~3 close paraphrases, ~4 missing critical items. Because critical role-specific requirements (datacenter automation, control-plane, principal leadership/scale) are absent and resume is internship-heavy despite good quantified work, the overall alignment is low.
Impact: Strong use of action verbs with multiple clear, measurable outcomes: e.g., “Automated a sentiment-analysis pipeline processing 1M+ records” with “5× faster feedback loops,” fine-tuned models improving accuracy ~5% and reducing toxicity ~8%, and teaching 36 lessons to 200+ learners with a 96% graduation rate. These metrics are relevant to efficiency and model performance. Deductions: several bullets lack quantification or business impact (e.g., “Designed and presented secure, scalable AWS reference architectures,” “Managed relations with 3rd‑party vendors,” and “Automated troubleshooting workflows” without numeric impact), so not every item meets the high bar for measurable results.
CredTail: Education fully VERIFIED: both degrees, dates (Master expected Jan 2026; B.Tech Jun 2024) and honors (GPA 4.0, 3.78, Dean’s List counts) exactly match the Retrieval Context. Experience fully VERIFIED: all four roles (Solutions Architect Intern at AWS Jun 2025–Sep 2025; Software Developer Intern at WOPLLI Jun 2024–Sep 2024; IT Support Intern at Mayor’s Office Feb 2024–May 2024; IT Instructor Assistant Feb 2022–Aug 2023) and their highlights are mirrored in the context. Core Skills largely VERIFIED: Python (pandas, scikit-learn, seaborn, PyTorch), SQL/NoSQL, AWS services (including Bedrock, SageMaker, Glue, QuickSight, Macie), Azure items, ETL/ELT, CI/CD, Docker, APIs, R, and ML topics are present. Fabrications/MISSING in Core Skills: Java is not present in the Retrieval Context, and explicit claims of “Technical Leadership” and “Communication” are not enumerated in the core_skills list (treated as missing). I applied a strong penalty to the Core Skills subscore for these missing claims. Subscores: Education 10/10, Experience 10/10, Core Skills 6/10 (after penalty). Aggregated credibility score is 9/10, driven by fully verified education and experience and minor missing items in core skills (Java, Technical Leadership, Communication).",148,2025-12-18 19:15:30.500749,9,9

Tone: Professionalism is strong: clean formatting, consistent tone, good grammar, and clear sections (contact, summary, skills, experience, education, certifications). Persona alignment is also strong for AWS/Data Science/Solutions Architect roles—skills and internships (Bedrock, SageMaker, Glue, QuickSight, AWS certs) map well to the target industry. Action-orientation is slightly weaker: many strong action verbs and some measurable items (""1M+ records"", ""36 lessons for 200+ learners"", GPAs), but several impact statements lack concrete metrics or quantified results (e.g., ""improving accuracy and reducing toxicity"", ""shortens feedback loops"" are vague). Because the Action-Oriented category is one point below the highest scores, there is a noted imbalance. Overall average yields a high score reflecting these strengths with that noted gap.
Alignment: Extracted 14 core requirements from the Oracle Principal role (leadership, software design/debug, architecture changes, massive-scale distributed cloud services, HA/service-oriented design, virtualization, datacenter automation/physical-asset domain, Java/Python, production ops, control-plane/data-plane, performance diagnosis, communication/design docs, CS fundamentals, service-to-service protocols). Resume explicitly matches 7 (software design, architecture, HA/microservices, Python, communication, CS fundamentals, APIs) and implies 4 (some leadership/teaching, cloud scale experience on AWS, production/ops practices, performance work) while 3 are absent (virtualization, datacenter automation domain, control-/data-plane experience) → match = (7 + 0.5*4)/14 ≈ 64% → baseline score ~6. I subtracted 1 point for ignoring Oracle/OCI/datacenter-automation and senior/principal-level leadership specifics, and added 1 point for clear measurable outcomes and explicit cloud/Python tooling (e.g., 1M+ record pipeline, AWS services), yielding a final score of 6.
Impact: The resume includes multiple explicit action verbs and concrete metrics (Step 1): e.g., “Automated a sentiment-analysis pipeline processing 1M+ records” with real-time QuickSight dashboards, “Delivered 36 lessons covering… for 200+ learners,” and clear academic metrics (4.0 GPA, 3.78 GPA). That warrants a high base. Compared to typical outputs (Step 2) it has stronger measurable accomplishments. I applied a small penalty for some vague/non‑quantified claims (Step 3), such as “reduced toxicity” and “reduced manual workload” without percentages or time saved. I then added a point for clear ownership and direct business impact from the sentiment pipeline and reference architectures (Step 4). Overall assessment balances strong metrics and a few vague statements.
CredTail: High fidelity to the Retrieval Context: all employers (AWS; WOPLLI Technologies; Mayor’s Office of Information Services; RF CUNY & Generation USA) and their dates match exactly, and both degrees (M.S. expected Jan 2026; B.Tech Jun 2024) and certifications match. Core technologies largely match (Python, SQL/NoSQL, AWS services including Bedrock/SageMaker/Glue/QuickSight, Azure, Glue/SSIS ETL, FastAPI/Postman, Docker, Git, PostgreSQL/MySQL/Oracle/MongoDB/DynamoDB). Minor omissions/partial matches: the Actual Output omits some detailed core-skill items from the Retrieval Context (specific Python libs like pandas/scikit-learn/PyTorch, explicit “Generative AI” and some security items such as SIEM/IDS), and it drops a few numeric performance details from the AWS highlights (exact % improvements). No fabricated items were found. These small omissions justify a slight penalty from perfect alignment.",149,2025-12-18 19:16:13.619381,9,9

Tone: Professionalism: very professional—clear sections, consistent formatting, good grammar. Action-Oriented: highly action-driven with multiple quantified outcomes (e.g., 1M+ records, 5× faster feedback loops, +5% accuracy, −8% toxicity, 60% reduced application time, 300% more weekly applications). Persona Alignment: excellent fit for a data science/ML candidate—relevant internships (AWS, SageMaker), projects (Isolation Forest, ARIMA, FastAPI + GPT-4.1), and tools/skills listed. All three sub-scores are strong (5/5 each), average 5.0 and mapped to the 0–10 scale, yielding the final score.
Alignment: Step 1 (responsibilities): The JD emphasizes improving AI model intelligence/safety and high-quality data for LLMs. The resume explicitly matches model performance/safety (SageMaker fine-tuning: +5% accuracy, -8% toxicity — marked critical) and large-scale data processing (automated sentiment pipeline handling 1M+ records — marked critical). LLM-related work is present in projects (Alfred using OpenAI GPT-4.1 — optional). Match count: 2 critical + 1 optional. Step 2 (tools/tech): The resume lists relevant tooling (SageMaker, AWS, OpenAI GPT-4.1, Azure, Docker, Git) — several exact matches to typical JD expectations — but lacks explicit mention of labeling/annotation platforms or Scale AI/Labelbox (missing must-have for a data-quality/annotation-focused role). Step 3 (outcomes/metrics): The resume provides multiple concrete metrics (1M+ records, 5× faster, +5% accuracy, -8% toxicity, 60% time reduction, 300% application increase, 96% cohort graduation) — strong measurable outcomes. Scoring: responsibility match = 2/3, tools = 2/3, measurable outcomes = 3/3; no exceptional company-specific tailoring, and missing annotation-tool experience leads to a -1 penalty. Overall score reflects good technical alignment and strong metrics but gaps in explicit data-labeling/Scale AI experience and lack of company-specific tailoring.
Impact: Multiple bullets contain an action verb, a precise measurable result, and a clear business outcome (e.g., “Automated sentiment-analysis pipeline processing 1M+ records, enabling 5× faster feedback loops”; “Fine-tuned models… improving accuracy by 5% and reducing toxicity by 8%”; Alfred project reduced application time by 60% and increased weekly applications by 300%; 96% cohort graduation for 200+ learners). Metric quality is high (exact counts, %, and multiples), earning full metric credit. A minor penalty was applied for several vague/unspecified-impact bullets (e.g., “Developed API integrations…”, “Configured Azure environments…”, “Automated troubleshooting workflows…”) that lack measurable outcomes.
CredTail: Strong alignment on high-priority items: name/contact/links, both degrees (MSc Data Science & Machine Learning — Expected Jan 2026, GPA 4.0; B.Tech Computer Information Systems — Jun 2024, GPA 3.78), employers and dates (AWS Jun 2025–Sep 2025; WOPLLI Jun 2024–Sep 2024; Mayor’s Office Feb 2024–May 2024; RF CUNY Feb 2022–Aug 2023), project Alfred (FastAPI + OpenAI GPT-4.1 mini, 60% time reduction / 300% increase), and AWS/SageMaker sentiment-pipeline metrics — all explicitly supported by the Retrieval Context. Exact matches: personal info, degrees+dates+GPAs, listed internships and dates, Alfred project metrics, AWS/Azure/Docker/Git/Python/R/SQL/PostgreSQL/MySQL/NoSQL/SageMaker references. Partial match: institution naming simplified to “City University of New York” vs. full campus names in source. Discrepancies (penalized): Actual Output lists Tableau, Java, and JavaScript among core technologies but those three are not present in the Retrieval Context (unsupported technologies; each treated as a high-priority tech discrepancy per rubric). Missing but present in source: multiple certifications are in the Retrieval Context but omitted from the Actual Output (not heavily penalized by the rubric but noted). No direct contradictions or suspected fabrications detected.

Strong persona alignment: content and terminology clearly target cloud/ML/solutions-architecture roles (AWS services, Bedrock, SageMaker, Glue, Athena, LLM-focused project “Alfred”). Minor shortcoming: core-competencies list is dense and could be streamlined for readability, but overall the resume matches the evaluation criteria closely.
Alignment: Strong matches on Python, cloud (AWS/Azure), microservices, APIs and production practices with concrete metrics (1M+ record pipeline, 5× faster feedback loops, model improvements, Alfred project reductions), but lacks Principal-level leadership evidence, Java/OCI/datacenter-automation/control-plane experience and explicit large-scale HA/multi-tenant system ownership; applied a moderate generic-content penalty for limited senior/organizational leadership signals.
Impact: High use of action-oriented language (multiple strong verbs: Designed, Built, Automated, Fine-tuned) and concrete tasks across roles, satisfying step 1. Contains numerous measurable results (1M+ records processed, 5× faster feedback loops, ~5% accuracy improvement, ~8% toxicity reduction, 60% time reduction, 300% increase in weekly applications, 96% graduation rate, 800 devices refurbished), meeting the criteria for clear metrics in step 2. Many metrics tie to business outcomes — efficiency, model quality, user engagement and operational throughput — though not all are explicitly linked to revenue or cost savings, so business impact is implied/partly quantified (step 3). Relative comparison favors this output due to the volume of metrics and active ownership; only minor shortcomings are occasional lack of explicit baselines/timeframes for some percentages and a few vague bullets, so a small deduction for partial linkage to strategic KPIs rather than pervasive passive wording (step 4).
CredTail: All claims in the Actual Output are present and match the Retrieval Context. Degrees verified: MS Data Science & Machine Learning (CUNY SPS, Expected Jan 2026, GPA 4.0, Dean’s List 2x) and BTech Computer Information Systems (NYC College of Technology, Jun 2024, GPA 3.78, honors) are listed in the retrieval.

Tone: High professionalism: clean, well-structured resume with correct grammar, a strong Professional Summary, clear Education and Certifications (MS Data Science expected Jan 2026), and relevant headings. Action-oriented overall: many strong verbs (Designed, Developed, Automated, Fine-tuned, Delivered, Managed) and quantified results (automated pipelines processing over 1M records; 5× feedback-loop speed; 5% accuracy improvement; 96% graduation rate; refurbished 800 devices). Minor shortcomings: a few bullets and summary lines are somewhat generic/passive (e.g., “Committed to delivering,” broad claims about ""proven expertise"") and some achievements could be more specific about business impact. Persona alignment is strong for a Business Analyst with public-sector and AWS/ML focus, though the mix of Solutions Architect/ML detail slightly broadens the focus. Overall this merits a high score.
Alignment: Strengths: resume explicitly lists Agile/Scrum, requirements gathering, documentation/user story development, and a Bachelor’s in Computer Information Systems—matching some core responsibilities and tools. Shortcomings: it provides no concrete evidence of 8+ years of Business Analysis (work history shows internships and recent roles), omits key preferred domain experience (no demonstrated Human Services or SACWIS experience), lacks explicit artifacts/processes called for (JAD, design documents, mock-ups, acceptance criteria/test data with QA), does not state Microsoft Office proficiency, and is not tailored to the Sr Business Analyst title/location/company—measurable BA outcomes are mostly absent or tied to non-BA tasks. Overall, several high-priority items are missing or only partially implied.
Impact: I scored bullets by checking for explicit actions plus measurable outcomes and penalized vague/passive phrasing. Strongest drivers were bullets with concrete metrics and business outcomes (AWS: “automated data pipelines processing over 1M records” with a 5× feedback-loop speed increase; SageMaker fine-tuning with accuracy/toxicity improvements; IT Instructor: 36 lessons for 200+ learners with a 96% graduation rate). Mid-to-weak bullets lacked specificity or measurable results (e.g., “designed secure, scalable AWS architectures, enhancing application throughput”; “proof-of-concept… improving sentiment analysis efficiency”; “automated troubleshooting workflows, significantly reducing manual workload”; “collaborated with QA…”; “developed testing materials”), each of which triggered a 2-point penalty for non-actionable/vague phrasing. I ranked bullets by these per-bullet scores and computed the final rating as the normalized average, with the quantified AWS/teaching bullets driving the score up and the vague, unmeasured bullets pulling it down.
CredTail: Ground truth from Retrieval Context — Degrees: M.S.

Employers/dates: AWS — Solutions Architect Intern (Jun 2025–Sep 2025); WOPLLI Technologies — Software Developer Intern (Jun 2024–Sep 2024); Mayor’s Office of Information Services — IT Support Intern (Feb 2024–May 2024); RF CUNY & Generation USA — IT Instructor Assistant (Feb 2022–Aug 2023). Core technologies (examples): Python (pandas, scikit-learn, PyTorch), SQL/NoSQL, AWS (EC2, S3, Lambda, Glue, QuickSight, Bedrock, SageMaker), Azure, FastAPI, Docker, PostgreSQL+pgvector, RAG/OpenAI integrations, Power BI, etc. Comparison of Actual Output to Retrieval Context: Degrees — Exact Match; AWS Solutions Architect Intern (Jun–Sep 2025) — Exact Match; Mayor’s Office IT Support Intern and IT Instructor Assistant — Exact Matches; Certifications (AWS Solutions Architect, AWS AI Practitioner, Google Cybersecurity, Google Information Support) — Exact Matches; Core skills listed in Actual Output (SQL/NoSQL, QuickSight, Power BI, Agile/Scrum, SDLC) — Exact Matches to subsets of retrieval. Partial Match: “Human Services & State Government Expertise” (inferred from Mayor’s Office experience but not an explicit retrieval skill label). Missing/Omissions affecting coverage: the Software Developer Intern at WOPLLI Technologies (Jun 2024–Sep 2024) present in retrieval is omitted from Actual Output; several major technical items from retrieval (Python, explicit AWS services like Bedrock/SageMaker, FastAPI, Docker, PostgreSQL+pgvector, RAG project) are not presented in the Actual Output. No clear fabrications (no claims contradict retrieval). Scoring and penalties: high fidelity on core credentials, employers, dates, and certifications — strong alignment; deducted points for omitted WOPLLI internship (coverage gap) and for omission of multiple significant technical skills/projects (reduced technical coverage). Final assigned score: 8 — reflects very good factual alignment on key items with minor coverage gaps (documented above).",74,2025-12-18 19:03:56.275601,6,8

Tone: Professionalism (5/5): resume uses a polished, formal tone, correct grammar, and clear structure (Professional Summary, Education, Core Skills, Experience, Projects). Action-Oriented (5/5): consistently uses strong action verbs and quantifies impact (e.g., automated pipeline processing 1M+ records, 5× faster feedback loops, accuracy +~5% / toxicity -~8%, Alfred project: time-to-apply -60%, applications +300%). Persona Alignment (4/5): skills and responsibilities (AWS, .NET, microservices, architecture) fit a Solutions Architect role, but the stated “over 8 years” experience conflicts with the recent internship-heavy timeline and graduation dates, which weakens seniority credibility. Calculated average = 4.7/5 (scaled to the 0–10 range). No inconsistency flag — no two category scores differ by more than 1.
Alignment: Step 1 (responsibilities): Resume claims solutions-architect skills and shows architecture, API development, custom app design and automation experience but lacks demonstrated 8+ years and no accounting-vertical leadership or clear team-lead responsibilities — matched ~4 of 6 core responsibilities (assigning partial credit). Step 2 (tools/technologies): Both required technologies from the JD (.NET and API development) appear explicitly in the resume (full match). Step 3 (outcomes/metrics): Resume includes measurable results (1M+ records processed, 5× faster feedback loops, model improvements ~5%/~8%, 60% time reduction on a project), but these metrics are not tied to accounting or senior leadership outcomes (partial match). Penalization: resume leans generic and claims 8+ years despite largely internship experience and lacks accounting-specific or clear team leadership detail, so a 2–3 point penalty is applied. Overall strengths: clear API/automation work, metrics, and .NET listed; key shortcomings: no accounting vertical experience, weak evidence of 8+ years and team leadership.
Impact: The output contains multiple explicit, action-oriented statements with clear metrics and business-relevant outcomes (e.g., automated sentiment pipeline processing 1M+ records with 5× faster feedback loops; fine-tuning that improved accuracy ~5% and reduced toxicity ~8%; reduced application time by 60% and increased weekly applications by 300%; maintained a 96% graduation rate). These are strong, measurable results that align with the evaluation steps. Minor shortcomings: several bullets remain metric-free (e.g., “designed and presented reference architectures,” “built POCs” without impact or timeframe) and some claims lack business context (revenue/ROI), so a small penalty was applied for uneven metric coverage.

Data Science & ML expected Jan 2026; B.Tech June 2024 with GPAs and honors), all four employers and their exact internship dates (AWS Jun 2025–Sep 2025; WOPLLI Jun 2024–Sep 2024; Mayor’s Office Feb 2024–May 2024; RF CUNY & Generation USA Feb 2022–Aug 2023), project details (Alfred) and the listed certifications all appear in the retrieval context. Core technologies are overwhelmingly supported (Python with pandas/scikit-learn/PyTorch, SQL/NoSQL, AWS services EC2/S3/Lambda/RDS/DynamoDB/Glue/QuickSight, Azure App Service/Functions/Storage, Docker, Git, SageMaker, Bedrock, etc.). Deductions: the résumé’s claim of “over 8 years of experience” is not present in the retrieval context (unsupported), and a couple of phrasing differences (“API Development” and “Custom Application Design”) are not verbatim in the structured skills list (minor mismatch). Given full support for degrees, employers, dates, certifications, projects and nearly all technologies, but one unsupported experience claim and small wording mismatches, the output earns a high but not perfect credibility score.",122,2025-12-18 19:17:44.615218,9,8

Close/paraphrase: customer-facing and cross-functional work (presented architectures to enterprise clients), and limited Azure exposure (resume notes configuring/testing Azure environments). Missing or weak: little Microsoft/Azure platform depth relevant to the Azure CXP role, limited explicit evidence of improving cloud quality/reliability telemetry or large-scale reliability/security engineering (CXP focus), and minimal explicit customer-experience/advocacy outcomes tied to cloud product improvement. Specificity is good for ML projects but the heavy AWS focus and lack of Azure/Microsoft-tailored impact justify a moderate score.
Impact: Strong use of action verbs with multiple clear, specific metrics: 7 distinct quantifiable outcomes (processing over 1M feedback records; 5× faster feedback-to-action; 5% accuracy gain; 8% reduction in toxicity/hallucinations; 36 lessons; 200+ learners; 96% graduation rate). Metrics are tied to business impact (throughput, accuracy, customer outcomes). Points deducted because several bullets remain vague or lack measurable results (POC, architecture design, Azure/configuration items) and a few metrics lack explicit baselines/timeframes, so not every bullet meets the rubric for measurable impact.
CredTail: Education: Both degrees, GPAs, institutions and expected/graduation dates are present in the Retrieval Context (2/2 verified) → subscore 10/10. Experience: All four roles, companies, locations and dates (AWS Jun–Sep 2025; WOPLLI Jun–Sep 2024; Mayor’s Office Feb–May 2024; IT Instructor Feb 2022–Aug 2023) and the listed highlights match the Retrieval Context (4/4 verified) → subscore 10/10. Core Skills: Nearly all claimed technologies and tools (AWS services including Bedrock/SageMaker/Glue/QuickSight/Macie, Python/pandas/PyTorch, SQL/NoSQL, FastAPI/Postgres+pgvector, Docker, Git, etc.) are in the Retrieval Context; one claimed item (Tableau) is not present in the Retrieval Context and is treated as missing/fabricated → core subscore 8/10 with a strong penalty for the missing item. Aggregating subscores and applying the fabrication penalty yields a final credibility rating driven by fully verified education and experience and a small gap in core skills. Fabricated/missing items explicitly: Tableau. Note: Retrieval artifacts contain a minor inconsistency in Dean’s List counts (8x vs 5x) but the Actual Output aligns with the structured profile's honors, so no contradiction was marked for education.",153,2025-12-18 19:18:24.763427,9,9
64,1637,P4,9.666666666666666,10,4,35.666666666666664,"Punctuality: The score is 0.97 because the actual output understates the number of devices: it claims restoring 400+ devices, while the Artifacts/structured profile in the retrieval context states refurbished and tracked over 800 devices for redeployment.
Tone: Professionalism: well-formatted, clear sections, correct grammar, and polished resume presentation. Action-oriented: strong use of verbs and multiple quantified achievements (processed 1M+ records, 5× faster pipeline, +5% model accuracy/-8% toxicity, 30% workload reduction, 400+ devices restored, 96% graduation rate) that emphasize impact. Persona alignment: excellent fit for cloud/data/solutions roles—AWS, SageMaker, CI/CD, microservices, relevant certifications and advanced degrees all match the target persona. Scores are consistent with each other (no meaningful gap). Minor shortcoming: could add brief context on project scale or specific technologies/framework versions for deeper technical clarity.
Alignment: Responsibility match: Resume only explicitly satisfies .NET and API development from the JD (both critical). Missing critical items: 8+ years of experience, leadership/technical oversight of engineers, and domain-specific (accounting vertical) automation or explicit custom application design. Tools/technologies: Strong matches for .NET, API development, CI/CD, AWS/Azure, SQL (several exact matches); custom application design is implied but not clearly documented. Outcomes/metrics: Multiple concrete metrics (1M+ records processed, 5× faster, 5% accuracy gain, 30% workload reduction, 60% application-time reduction, etc.), which is a strength, but these results are not tied to accounting/accounting automation. Scoring rationale applied per steps: limited responsibility alignment (low), good tools overlap (medium), strong measurable outcomes (high), minus points for lack of required experience, leadership evidence, and domain tailoring. Overall alignment is weak-to-moderate.
Impact: Most resume bullets contain an action verb, a measurable result, and a clear business outcome (e.g., “Automated sentiment-analysis pipeline, processing 1M+ records, achieving 5× faster feedback”; “Fine-tuned models… improving accuracy by 5% and reducing toxicity by 8%”; “Automated troubleshooting… reducing manual workload by 30%”; “Restored 400+ devices”; “Taught… 200+ learners, 96% graduation”; “Reduced application time by 60%, boosting weekly applications by 300%”). Metric quality is high (precise counts/percentages and documented internship timeframes), so I awarded full metric points. There is minor vague phrasing in a few lines (e.g., “Designed AWS architectures, enhancing scalability” and “Developed resources enhancing student engagement”) so I applied a small clarity penalty. Overall alignment with the evaluation steps is strong, yielding the highest normalized score.
CredTail: Strong alignment on many high-priority items: name, email, LinkedIn, phone (347-491-2955), location, summary, Solutions Architect Intern at AWS (Arlington, VA) with dates Jun 2025–Sep 2025 and matching SageMaker/QuickSight/sentiment-pipeline metrics, IT Support Intern (Mayor’s Office) dates Feb 2024–May 2024, IT Instructor Assistant Feb 2022–Aug 2023, Alfred project details (60% time reduction, CI/CD) and many core skills (Python, SQL, AWS EC2/S3/Lambda, Azure App Service/Functions, SageMaker, SIEM/Active Directory, CI/CD) are explicitly supported by the Retrieval Context. Discrepancies found and penalties applied per instructions: (1) Missing employer/role: the Software Developer Intern at WOPLLI Technologies (Jun 2024–Sep 2024) appears in the Retrieval Context but is omitted from the Actual Output (−2). (2) Direct contradiction in IT Support device counts: Retrieval Context says “refurbished and tracked over 800 devices” vs Actual Output “restored 400+ devices” (treated as suspected contradiction −4). (3) Unsupported core technology: Actual lists JavaScript but Retrieval Context does not explicitly list JavaScript (−2). Score calculation: start 10 −2 −4 −2 = 2. Recommend verifying the omitted WOPLLI role, the device counts/wording with the Mayor’s Office (possible fabrication or summary change), and the JavaScript claim against source material for confirmation.",116,2025-12-18 19:19:11.289805,10,2

Tone: Professionalism: clear, formal, and consistently styled with correct grammar and a logical layout (contact, certifications, education, experience, projects). Strengths include concise headings and consistent bullet formatting. Action-Oriented: strong verbs and measurable outcomes throughout (e.g., “automated a sentiment-analysis pipeline processing 1M+ records,” “5× faster feedback loops,” “improving accuracy by ~5%,” “reducing toxicity by ~8%,” and a 96% cohort graduation rate), demonstrating result focus. Persona Alignment: content and vocabulary closely match cloud/data/ML roles (AWS services, SageMaker, Bedrock, RAG, FastAPI, CI/CD), certifications, and a relevant project (Alfred) that reinforce the target persona. No category is substantially weaker than the others (no score is one point or more below the highest), so the evaluation shows balanced strengths across professionalism, action-orientation, and persona fit.
Alignment: I extracted 10 core requirements from the Applied Scientist (Azure CXP) posting and found 7 explicit matches (cloud architecture, ML/LLMs, data engineering, customer-facing solutions, measurable outcomes such as a 1M+ record pipeline, 5× faster feedback, model fine-tuning) + 2 implied matches (cloud reliability/security improvements and cross-team collaboration) and 1 absent item (specific Azure tooling/monitoring details). Match rate was high, but I applied a one-point penalty for the resume’s heavy AWS focus and limited Azure-specific tooling versus a one-point bonus for clear measurable outcomes, yielding a strong but imperfect fit to the Microsoft Azure-focused role.
Impact: Strong use of active verbs and multiple concrete metrics: automated pipeline processing 1M+ records, delivered 5× faster feedback loops, fine‑tuned models improving accuracy ~5% and reducing toxicity ~8%, plus 36 lessons for 200+ learners and a 96% graduation rate. These demonstrate clear ownership and measurable business/learning outcomes. Minor vagueness in a few bullets (e.g., “designed and presented secure, scalable AWS architectures” lacks quantified impact), so a small penalty was applied before a final boost for explicit business impact and ownership.
CredTail: Most critical fields match the Retrieval Context: personal info (name, location, email, phone, LinkedIn, GitHub) are exact; education entries (MS Data Science & ML expected Jan 2026, GPA 4.0; B.Tech CIS Jun 2024, GPA 3.78, Dean’s List, National Honor Society) are exact; employers and dates (Solutions Architect Intern at AWS Jun 2025–Sep 2025; Software Developer Intern WOPLLI Jun 2024–Sep 2024; IT Support Feb 2024–May 2024; IT Instructor Feb 2022–Aug 2023) are exact; core technologies and projects (AWS services including Bedrock, Glue, SageMaker; FastAPI + PostgreSQL + pgvector + OpenAI GPT-4.1 mini for Alfred) align closely. Shortcomings: one certification present in the Retrieval Context (Google Information Support Certificate) is omitted in the Actual Output, and several experience highlights (e.g., CrowdStrike monitoring, device refurbishment, some WOPLLI POC/vendor details) are truncated/missing. No fabricated items were detected. Given complete verification of degrees, employers, dates and core tech and only minor omissions, the credibility is high but not perfect, so the score reflects a small penalty for the missing certification and truncated highlights.",154,2025-12-18 19:19:24.960811,9,9
46,1045,P4,9.6,9,4,31.6,"Punctuality: The score is 0.96 because the sole contradiction is that the actual output lists the Mayor’s Office of Information Services IT Support Intern role as ""Feb 2024 – Current,"" while the retrieval context documents the correct period as ""Feb 2024 – May 2024,"" creating a dates mismatch.
Tone: Professionalism: clear, well-structured resume with correct grammar, concise summary, and appropriate headings. Action-oriented: strong action verbs and quantifiable outcomes (restored 400+ devices, 30% reduction in workload, 96% graduation rate, 65,000+ records) that emphasize impact. Persona alignment: generally well-tailored to an entry-level business-analysis/tech role (Agile/Scrum, SQL, Python, AWS), but could be improved by adding BA-specific tools/metrics, clearer stakeholder impact, and minor formatting consistency fixes. These strengths and a few scope/tailoring gaps drove the rating.
Alignment: Partial alignment. Strengths: explicitly lists requirement gathering and JAD, Agile (3+ years), Microsoft Office proficiency, and strong communication/documentation — also includes measurable metrics in unrelated tasks (device restores, graduation rate). Shortcomings: misses top-priority items from the job (no 8+ years of Business Analysis experience, no State/Human Services or SACWIS SME experience), lacks explicit examples of analyzing Product Owner needs/user stories, defining acceptance criteria or test data with QA, and tracing requirements to measurable project success criteria. Resume is not tailored to the Sr Business Analyst role/company/location and contains mostly generic/entry-level evidence for the required senior responsibilities.
Impact: I scored nine achievement bullets individually and averaged them. Strong bullets with explicit actions plus measurable outcomes — the IT Instructor entry (36 lessons to 200+ learners, 96% graduation), automated workflows (30% reduction in manual work), restoring 400+ devices, and generating reports from 65,000+ records — drove the rating up. Weakeners were bullets that lack measurable business outcomes or use vague/non-actionable phrasing (unquantified “high satisfaction” for VIP service; multiple documentation, customization, and prototype statements), which I penalized per the instructions for vague language. The final rating reflects the normalized average after those per-bullet scores and penalties.
CredTail: Ground truth from Retrieval Context: Bachelor of Technology (Computer Information Systems), City University of New York – NYC College of Technology, dates Jun 2024, GPA ~3.78; Master of Science (Data Science & Machine Learning), CUNY SPS, expected Jan 2026, GPA 4.0; Experience: Solutions Architect Intern (Amazon Web Services) Jun 2025–Sep 2025; Software Developer Intern (WOPLLI Technologies) Jun 2024–Sep 2024; IT Support Intern, Mayor’s Office of Information Services Feb 2024–May 2024; IT Instructor Assistant (RF CUNY & Generation USA) Feb 2022–Aug 2023; Key technologies: Python (pandas, PyTorch), SQL/NoSQL, AWS (EC2,S3,Lambda,RDS,DynamoDB,Glue,QuickSight,Bedrock,SageMaker), Azure, FastAPI, PostgreSQL+pgvector, Docker, LLM/Generative AI, QuickSight/PowerBI, etc.; Project: Alfred (FastAPI + OpenAI, pgvector, CI/CD). Comparison of Actual Output vs Retrieval Context (summary of each claim): - Bachelor's degree: Partial Match (Actual lists B.Tech, same school but Expected Grad May 2024 and GPA 3.8 vs retrieval Jun 2024, GPA 3.78 — minor date/GPA discrepancy). - Master’s degree: Missing in Actual Output (present in Retrieval Context). - AWS Solutions Architect & WOPLLI internships: Missing (both present in Retrieval but not listed in Actual Output). - Mayor’s Office experience dates and metrics: Fabricated/Contradicted (Retrieval: Feb 2024–May 2024 and ~800 devices refurbished; Actual: Feb 2024–Current and ‘restored 400+ devices’ – date contradicts and device counts differ). - IT Instructor Assistant: Exact Match (dates and metrics align). - Core technologies: Partial Match (Actual lists SQL, Python, AWS and Microsoft Office — covers some retrieval items but omits many specific technologies and generative-AI/ML and data tooling present in Retrieval). - Projects: Alfred project is Missing from Actual; Actual lists different projects not present in Retrieval. - Contact/phone: Partial (Actual uses 929-305-7353 which appears in Retrieval Artifacts but structured profile lists 347-491-2955 — ambiguous). Penalties applied (from perfect 10): - Missing Master’s degree: -2 - Missing AWS & WOPLLI internships: -2 ( -1 each) - Fabricated/contradicted Mayor’s Office date (and device/count discrepancy): -2 - Missing Alfred project and omission of major projects: -1 - Limited core-technology coverage vs Retrieval (many omitted): -1 Total deductions: -8 => Final score justification: many significant omissions (graduate degree and multi internships/projects) plus at least one contradicted employment date reduce credibility substantially.

Tone: All three evaluation dimensions meet top expectations. Professionalism: resume is formal, well-structured, and grammatically clean with clear headings and contact info (small issues: minor markdown remnants and a typo like “Postgre”). Action-Oriented: consistently uses strong verbs and numerous quantified outcomes (e.g., 1M+ records, 5× faster feedback loops, ~5% accuracy gain, ~8% toxicity reduction, 60% faster application time, 300% more weekly applications). Persona Alignment: terminology and emphasis align tightly with cloud/ML/LLM and solutions-architect work (AWS Bedrock/SageMaker/Glue/Athena, agentic AI, data pipelines). Minor redundancy in skills listings is the only notable shortcoming; otherwise category ratings are at the top of their 1–5 scales, yielding the maximum average on the required scale.
Alignment: Strong alignment on AI/ML tools and measurable outcomes (Exact matches: LLMs, PyTorch, SageMaker/Bedrock fine‑tuning; explicit metrics like 5× faster feedback loops, 1M+ records processed, accuracy +5%, toxicity −8%). Responsibilities partially match customer/engineering engagement (AWS solutions architect work and POCs map to customer‑facing, but analysis of customer needs and driving Cloud quality/security/reliability are only partially evidenced). Tools score is high overall but skewed toward AWS (Azure present but limited). No strong genericity penalties (concrete examples and metrics provided). Overall weighted match ≈67.5%, mapped to a score of 7 due to strong ML/tool evidence but missing deeper Azure/Microsoft and explicit cloud quality/security outcomes.
Impact: Strong active ownership throughout (many action verbs: Designed, Built, Automated, Fine-tuned, Developed, Managed). Multiple clear, measurable metrics are present (1M+ records processed; 5× faster feedback loops; ~5% accuracy improvement and ~8% toxicity reduction; 60% reduction in time to apply and 300% increase in weekly applications; 96% cohort graduation; 800+ devices refurbished). Business impact is stated or clearly implied (faster feedback loops, improved model quality, increased application throughput, device redeployment across agencies). Deduction from a perfect score because a few metrics lack explicit baselines/timeframes or broader context (e.g., the ~5% accuracy gain and some improvements lack the original baseline or exact timeframe).
CredTail: All claims in the Actual Output are supported by the Retrieval Context.

33,1605,P1,10,10,4,39,"Punctuality: The score is 1.00 because there are no contradictions listed, so the actual output fully aligns with the retrieval context — great job keeping it faithful!
Tone: Very strong alignment: highly professional formatting and grammar with clear sections and concise bullets; consistently action-oriented language (Designed, Built, Fine-tuned) and measurable outcomes (processed over 1M records, 5× faster feedback-to-action, 5% accuracy improvement, 8% reduction in toxicity, 96% cohort graduation) that emphasize impact; excellent persona fit for cloud/AI roles with explicit AWS/Bedrock/SageMaker/QuickSight, Generative AI, RAG, CI/CD, and FastAPI details. No notable shortcomings for the stated target roles.
Alignment: The resume shows relevant AWS technical skills and measurable outcomes (explicit use of SageMaker, Glue, Lambda, QuickSight, Bedrock; a 1M-record pipeline, 5× faster feedback-to-action, 5% accuracy / 8% toxicity improvements) and even an AWS Solutions Architect intern role — partial matches to the job’s technical toolset. However it omits the top-priority domain and role requirements: no Amazon Connect, contact-center (WFM/CRM) experience, no Partner/Go-to-Market or senior-level responsibilities (partner engagement, strategy, recruiting, WW scope, AWS WWSO Apps). Because several high-priority, role-specific items are missing and the resume isn’t tailored to Connect/contact-center or senior partner-facing outcomes, points were deducted.
Impact: I scored this a 6 because the resume contains several high-quality, measurable bullets (e.g., a fully automated sentiment pipeline processing over 1M records and enabling 5× faster feedback-to-action, and model fine-tuning yielding +5% accuracy and −8% toxicity, plus a 96% cohort graduation rate and 36 lessons for 200+ learners) which satisfy Step 1 and Step 2. However, many bullets lack concrete outcomes or metrics (e.g., VCS design, Azure configuration, API scripts, CI/CD deployment, and vague lines like “reducing manual workload” or “excellent service reviews”), lowering their individual scores. Passive/vague phrasing is limited but present in several entries, so those bullets were downgraded per Step 3. Averaging the per-bullet strengths and weaknesses and normalizing as required in Step 4 yields the final mid-range rating, with the measurable AI/education bullets driving the score up and the unspecified internship/project bullets driving it down.
CredTail: Ground truth extracted from Retrieval Context: Degrees — MS Data Science & Machine Learning (CUNY SPS, Expected Jan 2026, GPA 4.0) and B.Tech Computer Information Systems (CUNY NYC College of Technology, Jun 2024, GPA 3.78). Employers/dates — AWS (Solutions Architect Intern, Jun 2025–Sep 2025), WOPLLI Technologies (Software Developer Intern, Jun 2024–Sep 2024), Mayor’s Office of Information Services (IT Support Intern, Feb 2024–May 2024), RF CUNY & Generation USA (IT Instructor Assistant, Feb 2022–Aug 2023). Core technologies — AWS stack (EC2, S3, Lambda, RDS, DynamoDB, Glue, QuickSight, Bedrock, Macie, SageMaker), Python (pandas, scikit-learn, PyTorch), FastAPI, PostgreSQL+pgvector, OpenAI GPT-4.1 mini, Docker, CI/CD, Azure, SIEM/IDS/Active Directory/Linux, etc. Comparison: The Actual Output aligns closely — degrees, institutions, employer names, employment dates, and the vast majority of core technologies are Exact Matches. No Fabrications were found. Missing items: the Retrieval Context lists a second Google certification (“Google Information Support Certificate”) that is omitted from the Actual Output (Marked Missing) — applied a single-point penalty for this omission. Minor omissions (e.g., seaborn, R programming, master’s “Dean’s List 2x” honor) are present in the Retrieval Context but not emphasized in the resume; these are small omissions and did not incur additional penalty. Final score rationale: near-complete fidelity with one concrete missing certification from the Retrieval Context, no fabrications, and otherwise exact matches across degrees, employers, dates, and core technologies.",78,2025-12-18 19:01:37.240962,6,9

Tone: Professionalism: high—well-structured sections, consistent formatting, clear headings, and mostly correct grammar. Action-Oriented: strong—bullets begin with verbs (Designed, Built, Fine-tuned, Automated) and include measurable outcomes (1M records processed, 5× faster turnaround, % improvements). Persona Alignment: excellent—content is tailored to cloud/data/ML roles with specific technologies (AWS: Bedrock, SageMaker, Lambda; data tools: Athena, Glue; CI/CD, Docker) and relevant project impact. Minor shortcoming: one small grammatical article error (“a 8%” instead of “an 8%”), but it does not materially affect professionalism or role fit.
Alignment: Top priorities from the JD were Amazon Connect/contact-center solutions (WFM, CRM), partner/go-to-market strategy, and senior-level customer-facing impact with measurable business outcomes. The resume shows AWS experience (Solutions Architect Intern) and concrete, quantified technical outcomes (1M-record sentiment pipeline, 5× faster turnaround, model accuracy/toxicity improvements) and lists many AWS services (Bedrock, SageMaker, QuickSight, Glue, Lambda) — partial matches to cloud/AI tooling. However it omits explicit Amazon Connect, contact-center/WFM/CRM experience, partner or go-to-market ownership, and senior/customer-facing achievements tied to contact-center metrics. Also appears junior (intern) and contains some generic language not tailored to the WW Specialist role. For these reasons the alignment is limited.
Impact: I scored this a 5 because the resume contains a mix of very strong bullets with clear actions + measurable outcomes (e.g., sentiment pipeline processing >1M records enabling 5× faster feedback-to-action; SageMaker fine-tune with +5% accuracy and −8% toxicity; Alfred project with 60% faster apply time and +300% completed applications; teaching result of 96% graduation and 36 lessons for 200+ learners) which drove the rating up. However, many bullets are only descriptive without business metrics or concrete impact (designing VCS, configuring/testing Azure, producing architecture diagrams, supporting VIP users, several project implementation items), so I scored those mid-to-low and applied penalties for non-actionable/vague phrasing. I averaged per-bullet scores (17 bullets, average ≈5.4) and normalized/rounded to an overall integer score, noting the measurable LLM/pipeline, teaching, and Alfred metrics as the strongest drivers and the generic/metric-less operational bullets as the weakest.
CredTail: Ground truth (from Retrieval Context): Degrees — MS in Data Science & Machine Learning, CUNY School of Professional Studies, expected Jan 2026 (GPA 4.0); B.Tech in Computer Information Systems, CUNY NYC College of Technology, Jun 2024 (GPA 3.78, Dean’s List 5x, National Honor Society).

Mismatches found: 1) Bachelor’s Dean’s List count: Actual claims “Dean’s List (8x)” but Retrieval indicates Dean’s List (5x) for the bachelor’s degree — contradiction categorized as Fabricated. 2) “Tableau” is listed in Actual’s Technical Expertise but is not present in the Retrieval Context — categorized as Missing (claimed but absent). Penalties applied (documented): Fabricated: Bachelor’s Dean’s List count (contradicted by retrieval) → -2 points. Missing: Tableau (claimed in output but not in retrieval) → -1 point. Note: Other small omissions from retrieval (e.g., “Google Information Support Certificate”) were not claimed in Actual Output and thus not penalized. Final score is recorded in the score field; justification: overwhelmingly accurate reproduction of retrieval facts (degrees, institutions, employers, dates, project specifics, and core technologies) with only two minor errors (one fabrication and one missing claim) that reduce but do not materially undermine credibility.",80,2025-12-18 19:03:10.795208,5,8

Tone: Professionalism: resume is well-formatted and formal with clear headings, consistent bullets, and no casual language (minor typo: “Postgre” vs PostgreSQL). Action‑Oriented: uses strong verbs (Designed, Built, Automated, Fine‑tuned) and many quantified results (1M+ records, 5× faster feedback loops, accuracy +~5%, toxicity −~8%, 60% time reduction, 300% more applications, 800+ devices, 100+ tickets). Persona Alignment: terminology and emphasis align strongly with cloud/AI/solutions‑architect roles and early‑career/summer‑intern seniority (AWS Bedrock/Glue/SageMaker, FastAPI, CI/CD), with only slight mismatch between advanced tooling claims and intern titles. Overall strengths are professionalism, measurable outcomes, and tight industry alignment; only minor issues are a small database naming typo and potential seniority signal mismatch.
Alignment: Weighted match ≈60% → mapped to score 6. Strengths: clear technical fit for a Data Analyst role with Exact matches on tools/tech (Python, SQL/NoSQL, AWS, QuickSight/Power BI, ETL/data pipelines) and concrete outcomes in projects/internships (e.g., 5× faster feedback loops, 60% reduced apply time). Shortcomings: Missing eligibility/placement signals required by the job posting (OPT/STEM/GC/US‑citizen status, explicit participation in Hemma’s paid placement/training, and interview/placement outcomes through the program). No generic-content penalty applied since the resume includes company-specific roles, metrics, and concrete examples.
Impact: Strong active ownership throughout—multiple action verbs (e.g., Designed, Built, Automated, Fine-tuned, Implemented, Reduced) show clear task ownership. Includes many concrete metrics: processing 1M+ records, 5× faster feedback loops, ~5% accuracy improvement and ~8% toxicity reduction, refurbished 800+ devices, 96% graduation rate, 60% reduced application time and 300% increase in weekly applications—these are measurable and specific. Business impact is generally present and tied to efficiency, throughput, model quality, and user engagement, though direct revenue/cost figures or explicit baselines/timeframes are sometimes missing. Wording is mostly active with minimal passive constructions. Overall very strong on action and metrics, with minor shortcomings around explicit financial impact and baseline context.

Persona Alignment: good but slightly lower — terminology and AWS/ML focus (Bedrock, SageMaker, Glue, Athena) align well with cloud/ML roles, but mixed IT support/instructor duties and minor wording inconsistencies (e.g., “Postgre”) dilute a perfect match for a senior solutions-architect persona. Averaging these components yields a high overall score.
Alignment: Tools are a strong match (Python, SQL, Git, AWS Glue/Athena, QuickSight, ETL/ELT) and the resume includes concrete outcomes (1M+ record pipeline, 5× faster dashboards, model accuracy/toxicity improvements), but responsibilities are only partially demonstrated (limited explicit work on data-modeling patterns/Kimball/UML, system-to-model mapping, pragmatic tactical/strategic decision examples) and the resume lacks the required 5+ years of healthcare data experience; applying the weighted rubric (responsibilities 40%≈0.5, tools 30%≈0.75, outcomes 30%≈0.625 → ~61%), then a moderate generic-content penalty (-10%) yields ~51%, which maps to a score of 6.
Impact: The resume uses strong action-oriented language throughout (many explicit verbs: Designed, Built, Automated, Fine-tuned, Developed, Managed), showing clear ownership. It includes multiple concrete metrics (1M+ records processed, 5× faster feedback loops, ~5% accuracy improvement, ~8% toxicity reduction, 96% cohort graduation rate, 800+ devices, 36 lessons for 200+ learners) which demonstrate measurable outcomes. Business impact is implied and operationally meaningful (efficiency, model quality, onboarding/education outcomes) but lacks explicit financial or baseline context for some metrics and few entries tie improvements directly to revenue/cost savings, so impact linkage is not always explicit.

Tone: The resume is highly professional with clean formatting, correct grammar, and formal tone appropriate for technical roles; strengths include detailed AWS/GPU/CI-CD terminology and clear sectioning. It is very action-oriented, using strong verbs (Designed, Built, Automated, Fine-tuned) and multiple quantified outcomes (e.g., 1M+ records processed, 5× faster feedback loops, 60% time reduction, 300% application increase, accuracy/toxicity improvements), which show result focus. Persona alignment is strong for an early-career solutions architect/data scientist role—skills and projects reference Bedrock, SageMaker, Glue, pgvector, FastAPI, GitHub Actions and security tools—though there are minor consistency issues (e.g., “Postgre” instead of PostgreSQL and a few punctuation inconsistencies). Overall these strengths outweigh small polish issues.
Alignment: Strong alignment: resume explicitly demonstrates required responsibilities (designed scalable AWS architectures; built and automated ETL/data pipelines; presented enterprise-ready solutions), tools (AWS Glue, Athena, Lambda, S3, RDS, DynamoDB, SageMaker, QuickSight; Python/SQL), and measurable outcomes (1M+ records processed, 5× faster feedback loops, ~5% accuracy gain, 8% toxicity reduction, Alfred project metrics). Content is company/title-specific with concrete examples and metrics, so no generic-content penalty applied.
Impact: Strong alignment across the evaluation steps: the resume uses abundant action-oriented verbs (e.g., Designed, Built, Automated, Fine-tuned, Implemented) demonstrating clear ownership (Step 1). It contains multiple precise, measurable results (Step 2) — e.g., automated pipeline processing 1M+ records, 5× faster feedback loops, ~5% accuracy gain and ~8% toxicity reduction, 96% cohort graduation rate, refurbished 800+ devices, 60% time reduction and 300% increase in weekly applications — and includes timeframes (internship dates, project context). Metrics are tied to business outcomes (Step 3) such as operational efficiency, faster feedback, model quality improvements, and increased application throughput. Wording is predominantly active with few passive constructions, so no material deduction under the comparative step (Step 4).
CredTail: All claims in the Actual Output are supported by the Retrieval Context.

Tone: High professionalism: clean, well-structured formatting, consistent headings, and no casual language or grammar issues (clear contact block, summary, competencies). Strong action-orientation: frequent action verbs (Designed, Built, Automated, Fine-tuned), multiple quantified outcomes (processed 1M+ records, 5× faster feedback loops, ~5% accuracy gain, ~8% toxicity reduction, 60% time reduction, 300% increase in weekly applications). Excellent persona alignment: terminology and emphasis match cloud/AI solutions architect and data/ML roles (AWS services including Bedrock/SageMaker, LLMs, data pipelines, CI/CD, ETL) and the internship seniority is appropriate. Minor room to improve by adding a couple more high-level impact/ownership statements for enterprise outcomes, but overall the resume aligns very well with the evaluation criteria.
Alignment: Strong alignment: Exact matches for ETL development, RDBMS/data modeling, Big Data (Glue/Athena) and measurable outcomes (1M+ records, 5× faster feedback loops, Alfred reductions); Exact for Python and SQL; Partial evidence for PL/SQL and onsite availability (location listed but not explicit onsite commitment); PySpark is missing. Weighted match ≈81% and no generic-content penalty applied, mapping to a high score.
Impact: Strong active ownership with many action verbs (e.g., designed, built, automated, fine-tuned, implemented, reduced) meeting the action-oriented check. Contains numerous clear, measurable results (1M+ records processed, 5× faster feedback loops, ~5% accuracy improvement, ~8% toxicity reduction, 96% graduation rate, 800+ devices refurbished, 60% time reduction and 300% increase in weekly applications), so measurable-results criteria are well satisfied though some metrics lack explicit baselines or timeframes. Business impact is generally present and tied to outcomes (faster feedback, improved model quality, increased application throughput, operational efficiency) but not consistently quantified in revenue/cost terms. Minimal passive voice, so no major penalty. Overall strong alignment with the evaluation steps, with only minor gaps around baseline/timeframe and explicit monetary impact.

Tone: Professionalism: 4/5 — well-formatted, clear headings and strong grammar; minor polish issues (inconsistent ampersand usage, a few casual phrasings). Action-Oriented: 5/5 — heavy use of action verbs and measurable outcomes (e.g., “processing 1M+ records,” “5× faster feedback loops,” “~5% accuracy” improvements). Persona Alignment: 4/5 — content and tone align well with cloud/data/solutions architect roles (AWS, Bedrock, Glue, SageMaker), though experience is largely internship-level which slightly limits senior-role signaling. Average = (4 + 5 + 4) / 3 = 4.33. Highest: Action-Oriented. Lowest: Professionalism and Persona Alignment (tie).
Alignment: Extracted requirements included data collection/analysis, report/presentation prep, team collaboration, data QA, data visualization, database development/maintenance, and proficiency in Excel/SQL/Python plus coursework in a relevant field. The resume explicitly matches many items: pursuing an MS in Data Science (education requirement), lists Python and SQL, ETL/ELT tools (Glue, Athena), QuickSight/Power BI visualization, built an automated sentiment pipeline processing 1M+ records with quantified improvements (5× faster feedback, +5% accuracy, -8% toxicity), and database/cloud experience (RDS, DynamoDB) implying DB work. It also notes attention to detail and communication skills. Shortcomings: no explicit finance domain experience or mention of financial concepts (a stated plus for the role), Excel is not listed (though SQL/Python are present), and there is no FDR/FDR Financial Group-specific tailoring; explicit QA processes are implied but not clearly described. Given strong technical matches and quantified outcomes but missing domain/company tailoring and a couple minor gaps, the score reflects most requirements met with some deductions.
Impact: Several bullets contain clear action verbs plus concrete numeric metrics and business outcomes (notably the automated sentiment pipeline processing 1M+ records with 5× faster feedback loops; SageMaker fine-tuning improving accuracy ~5% and reducing toxicity ~8%; instructor role delivering 36 lessons to 200+ learners with a 96% graduation rate), which aligns well with the evaluation criteria for high specificity. Other bullets (e.g., “Designed and presented secure, scalable AWS reference architectures” and WOPLLI/AWS POC descriptions) use strong actions but lack explicit measurable results or business impact, and a few items use vague/supportive language (“Supported VIP users,” “Automated troubleshooting workflows… to reduce manual workload”) that triggers the penalty for unclear outcomes. The score balances multiple high-quality, numeric outcomes against several non-measured or passive statements.
CredTail: Verified: personal info (name, location, email, phone, LinkedIn, GitHub), summary, employers and roles (Solutions Architect Intern at AWS; Software Developer Intern at WOPLLI; IT Support Intern at Mayor’s Office of Information Services; IT Instructor Assistant at RF CUNY & Generation USA), dates for each role (Jun 2025–Sep 2025; Jun 2024–Sep 2024; Feb 2024–May 2024; Feb 2022–Aug 2023), education degrees and dates (M.S. expected Jan 2026; B.Tech Jun 2024), key AWS/Azure services and ML items (Bedrock, SageMaker, Glue, Athena/Lambda analytics, QuickSight, Python, SQL/NoSQL, Power BI). Missing: several core-technology items listed in the Retrieval Context but omitted from the Actual Output (explicit “Generative AI” skill line, R programming, containerization/Docker & CI/CD automation, some API/project-specific tech from the Alfred project such as FastAPI and PostgreSQL+pgvector). Fabricated/Contradicted: none identified. Scoring rationale: nearly all critical claims (degrees, employers, dates, major AWS/Azure/ML skills) are verified so initial credibility is high; applying a one-point penalty per Missing critical core-technology item (3 items) yields the final score.

Tone: Professionalism: 4/5 — resume is well-formatted, polished, and grammatically solid with clear headings and consistent bullets, though minor issues exist (e.g., “Postgre” likely should be PostgreSQL, some redundancy in competencies). Action-Oriented: 5/5 — frequent strong action verbs (Designed, Built, Automated, Fine-tuned) and many quantifiable outcomes (1M+ records, 5× faster feedback loops, ~5% accuracy gain, ~8% toxicity reduction, 96% graduation rate, 60% time reduction, 300% more applications). Persona Alignment: 5/5 — content and tone strongly match a Solutions Architect/Data+Generative AI persona (extensive AWS, Bedrock, SageMaker, data pipelines, agentic AI tooling). Average = (4 + 5 + 5) / 3 = 4.67; highest: Action-Oriented and Persona Alignment; lowest: Professionalism. Overall score scaled to 0–10 = 9.
Alignment: Extracted requirements include SQL, Excel, VBA, Python; strong Market Risk/Front Office experience; building prototypes (python, SQL, Excel/VBA); financial markets product knowledge; understanding regulatory landscape; partnering with GMFR/GRA/MRM; Data Analyst role at EGB Systems and Solutions. The resume explicitly shows strong Python and SQL skills, AWS/ETL/data-pipeline experience, and concrete prototypes/POCs with quantified outcomes (1M+ records, 5× faster dashboards, model accuracy improvements), which partially matches the prototype and technical requirements. However it omits Excel and VBA, contains no Market Risk/Front Office or financial markets product experience, lacks mention of regulatory knowledge or collaboration with GMFR/GRA/MRM, and does not target the Data Analyst title/company. Given solid technical matches but missing several key domain- and tool-specific requirements, the alignment is partial.
Impact: The resume contains multiple strong bullets with clear action verbs, numeric metrics, and tangible business impact (e.g., automated pipeline processing 1M+ records with 5× faster feedback loops; fine-tuned SageMaker models improving accuracy ~5% and reducing toxicity ~8%; Alfred project cutting time-to-apply by 60% and increasing weekly applications by 300%; instructor role: 36 lessons for 200+ learners with a 96% graduation rate). These demonstrate specificity and measurable outcomes across several items. Shortcomings: several bullets remain vague or lack metrics (e.g., “Designed and presented secure, scalable AWS reference architectures,” Azure/configuration tasks, and other generic responsibilities), so not every bullet meets the highest standard. Overall strong presence of numeric metrics and clear impact with a few unspecified items, so a high score is warranted.

Tone: High professionalism: polished, well-structured resume with clear grammar and consistent formatting (minor nit: “Postgre” could be “Postgres/PostgreSQL”). Strong action orientation: uses forceful verbs and measurable outcomes (e.g., “processed 1M+ records,” “5× faster feedback loops,” “improving accuracy by ~5%,” “reduced time to apply by 60% / boosted weekly applications by 300%”). Persona alignment is excellent for a solutions architect/data-science role—extensive AWS/Azure, ML, and deployment details and relevant projects. All three sub-scores are top-tier and there is no notable tonal inconsistency (>1.5).
Alignment: I extracted seven checklist items from the job text: cloud/solutions architecture, LLM/AI expertise, model intelligence & safety, high-quality data/pipelines for LLMs, collaboration with AI labs/experts, remote work capability, and company/platform-specific (Outlier/Scale AI) alignment. The resume explicitly matches cloud architecture (AWS reference architectures, AWS Solutions Architect role), LLMs/generative AI (Bedrock, fine-tuning, SageMaker), data pipelines and data-quality work (Glue/Athena/Lambda, 1M+ records, ETL), and safety/guardrails with concrete metrics (toxicity reduced ~8%, accuracy +5%, 5× faster feedback). Remote work is clearly shown. Collaboration is only partially evidenced (vendor management and internships but no explicit partnerships with top AI labs). Company/platform-specific alignment (Outlier/Scale AI) is absent. Overall coverage is strong (5 present, 1 partial, 1 absent), with high-quality metrics and many matching tools, so I applied a small deduction for lack of company-specific tailoring and limited explicit lab-collaboration evidence.
Impact: Strong use of explicit action verbs (Designed, Automated, Fine-tuned) and multiple concrete metrics (processed 1M+ records; 5× faster feedback loops; ~5% accuracy gain; 60% time-to-apply reduction; 300% more weekly applications; 96% cohort graduation) that map to clear business outcomes (reduced latency/increased throughput, improved model quality, higher applicant volume). Minor deduction for a few approximate metrics and some bullets that lack direct KPIs or revenue linkage. Justification: Action verb 'Automated' + metric '1M+ records processed / 5× faster feedback' => business outcome 'accelerated analytics feedback and increased throughput.'
CredTail: All major claims in the Actual Output are directly supported by the Retrieval Context’s Structured Profile: personal info (personal_info: name, location, email, phone, links) is present; summary and core_skills list match the core competencies entries; each experience entry (Solutions Architect Intern at Amazon Web Services, Jun 2025–Sep 2025; Software Developer Intern at WOPLLI, Jun 2024–Sep 2024; IT Support Intern at Mayor’s Office of Information Services, Feb 2024–May 2024; IT Instructor Assistant, Feb 2022–Aug 2023) and their highlights are in experience (see experience[0..3] dates/highlights). The Alfred project description and tech stack match projects (Alfred – Personal Agentic Job Search Assistant). Education (M.S. expected Jan 2026, GPA 4.0; B.Tech Jun 2024, GPA 3.78) and certifications lists are present in education and certifications. The only minor note is an internal Retrieval Context artifact that lists Dean’s List (8x) in one artifact, whereas the Structured Profile and Actual Output list 5x for the bachelor’s degree; the Actual Output aligns with the Structured Profile. No high-impact items appear fabricated or contradicted. Given near-complete verification of critical credentials and supporting excerpts in the Structured Profile (personal_info, experience, projects, education, certifications), the credibility score is maximal.",37,2025-12-18 18:12:19.259593,9,10

Tone: Scores: Professionalism = high (polished, clear sections, consistent formatting, no major grammar issues—contact, summary, certifications, education, experience and projects are well organized). Action-Oriented = high (uses strong verbs and many quantified outcomes such as “over 1M feedback records,” “5× faster feedback-to-action,” “5% increase in output accuracy,” “8% reduction in toxicity,” “60% time reduction,” and “300% increase in completed applications”). Persona Alignment = high (content and language strongly match a solutions-focused AWS/Generative-AI persona: relevant certifications, AWS and SageMaker/Bedrock experience, cloud and ML technical stack, and an agentic AI project “Alfred”). Minor note: primarily internship-level experience may signal early-career rather than senior hiring level, but this matches the stated persona. Overall strengths in polish, results orientation, and role fit.
Alignment: Strong alignment: the resume explicitly matches core responsibilities (designing AWS architectures, automated data pipelines, generative AI/LLM integration and safety) and lists relevant tools (Bedrock, SageMaker, Athena, Glue, Lambda, QuickSight, OpenAI, Docker). It provides quantified outcomes (1M+ records processed, 5× faster feedback-to-action, 5% accuracy gain, 8% reduction in toxicity, 60% time reduction, 300% more applications) which satisfy the KPI/outcome requirement. Minor shortcomings: experience is internship-focused (limited senior/long-term Cloud Solutions Architect production experience) and it lacks explicit mention of Scale/Outlier-specific data-labeling or large-scale ML ops programs, so not a perfect enterprise-level match.
Impact: Strong action-orientation with active ownership verbs across bullets (e.g., Designed, Developed, Built and deployed, Fine-tuned, Reduced, Achieved). Multiple clear, quantified metrics are provided (processed over 1M feedback records; 5× faster feedback-to-action; 5% accuracy increase and 8% reduction in toxicity; 60% time reduction and 300% increase in completed applications; 96% cohort graduation), satisfying measurable-results criteria. Business outcomes are clearly tied to those metrics (faster feedback-to-action, improved model quality, increased application throughput, high graduation rate). No significant passive or vague phrasing detected, so no penalty applied.
CredTail: Critical items (name, contact, education degrees and dates, employers, internship dates, and detailed AWS/ML project claims including SageMaker/Bedrock/QuickSight pipelines) are directly supported by the Retrieval Context and match line-by-line (Verified). There are a few minor Unverified items: the Languages section (English/Spanish) is not present in the structured retrieval, Tableau in the Technical Expertise list is not shown in the core_skills, and community membership dates (""2024 – Present"") are not present in the retrieval (missing dates). No items were contradicted. Because all critical fields (degrees, employers, and dates) are verified and only minor technology/metadata details are unverified, I assign a high credibility rating while noting those small gaps.",38,2025-12-18 18:15:28.004479,10,9

Action-Oriented: frequent strong verbs (Designed, Built, Automated, Fine-tuned), multiple quantified achievements (processed 1M+ records, 5× faster dashboards, ~5% accuracy gain, ~8% toxicity reduction, 96% cohort graduation, 800 devices refurbished), and result-focused phrasing. Persona Alignment: content strongly matches a solutions-architect / ML-focused persona with AWS services (Bedrock, SageMaker, Glue, Athena), generative AI, data pipelines, and relevant tooling—tone and emphasis align with employer expectations. No notable tone inconsistency (highest vs lowest scores equal).
Alignment: The resume shows partial tool alignment (explicit mentions of SQL, Python, R, QuickSight/Power BI, AWS ETL services) and includes measurable outcomes (automated pipeline processing 1M+ records, 5× faster dashboards, model accuracy/toxicity deltas). However it fails on core responsibilities and seniority: no 5+ years or multiple mature project deliveries (only internships), no evidence of leading cross-departmental business analyses, no logistics/company-specific customization (generic resume, not tailored to UniUni Logistics/Senior Data Analyst), and limited demonstration of building business-grade databases or multi-channel data acquisition. Overall several direct tool matches and some metrics but major responsibility and experience gaps justify a low-mid score.
Impact: Strong presence of explicit quantified results (≥2): automated sentiment pipeline processing 1M+ records with 5× faster feedback loops; SageMaker fine-tuning improving accuracy ~5% and reducing toxicity ~8%; plus other counts (36 lessons for 200+ learners, 96% graduation, 800 devices, 100 tickets). Action language is active and specific (Designed, Built, Automated, Fine-tuned, Developed), showing clear agency. Business linkage is present (efficiency/time-to-insight, model quality, operational improvements) but lacks explicit revenue or cost-savings figures and some impact descriptions could include clearer timeframes/scope. Using the given weights (metrics 50%, action 30%, business impact 20%) and minor deductions for missing explicit financial impact, the combined assessment supports a high rating.

Tone: The resume is highly professional: well-structured headings, clear contact/education/certifications, and strong domain signals (AWS/Bedrock, Athena/Glue/Lambda, SageMaker, 1M+ record pipeline, ‘5× faster’ feedback loops, ~5% accuracy gain and ~8% toxicity reduction). It is action-oriented with many impact-focused bullets (automated pipelines, fine-tuning, built POCs) though a few bullets are descriptive rather than metric-driven and the core-competencies list is dense/repetitive. Persona alignment is strong—content consistently supports a solutions-focused technologist with cloud + ML expertise and relevant internships/certs/GPA—so Action-Oriented and Persona Alignment logically support Professionalism with no significant imbalance. Minor shortcomings: overly long competency list and few direct project links/details to validate claims. Overall assessment yields a high final score based on these observations.
Alignment: Responsibilities: Strong matches for data collection/cleaning/analysis (ETL, pandas, Glue, Athena), reports/visualizations (QuickSight, Power BI), and supporting decisions (sentiment-analysis POC delivering insights). Partial match for data quality (automation/pipelines evident but no explicit audits/checks). Missing explicit mention of participating in team meetings. Tools/Technologies: Explicit matches (Python/pandas, SQL/NoSQL, R, AWS Glue/Athena/SageMaker/QuickSight, Power BI, Docker, Git). Outcomes/Metrics: Multiple concrete, quantified results (pipeline processing 1M+ records, 5× faster feedback loops, model accuracy +~5%, toxicity −~8%, 96% cohort graduation). Specificity adjustment: resume reads generic/senior-focused (Solutions Architect/AI emphasis) and is not tailored to CityWonders Data Analyst Intern — penalty applied. Positive adjustments for many named tools and quantified outcomes. Overall assessment weights responsibilities (50%), tools (30%), outcomes (20%) to compute base alignment, then applied specificity penalty and concrete-evidence bonuses.
Impact: Most bullets include both action verbs and clear metrics/business outcomes (meets Step 1). Examples: automated sentiment pipeline processing 1M+ records with 5× faster feedback loops; fine-tuned models improving accuracy ~5% and reducing toxicity ~8%; refurbished 800+ devices; delivered 36 lessons to 200+ learners with a 96% graduation rate. These demonstrate explicit metrics and business impact per Step 2. Shortcomings: several entries remain vague or lack ROI/quantified outcomes (e.g., “managed relations with 3rd‑party vendors,” “produced data‑flow diagrams”), which reduces clarity on overall business value. Given strong measured results with a few gaps in specificity, the output scores high.

Core Skills: the listed technologies and services (Python libs, SQL/NoSQL, AWS services including Bedrock/SageMaker/Glue/QuickSight/etc., Azure items, ETL, generative AI, databases, algorithms, etc.) align with the structured core_skills. No contradictions or clear fabrications identified; no penalties applied. Final credibility judgment reflects full support across categories.",19,2025-12-18 15:15:21.370611,9,10
11,682,P0,10,10,4,42,"Punctuality: The score is 1.00 because the contradictions list is empty, indicating no discrepancies between the actual output and the retrieval context—well done!
Tone: Professionalism: top-tier — clean, consistent formatting, correct grammar, and well-organized sections (contact, summary, competencies, experience, projects, education, certs). Action-oriented: very strong — frequent action verbs (Designed, Built, Automated, Fine-tuned, Implemented) and multiple quantified outcomes (1M+ records, 5× faster feedback loops, ~5% accuracy gain, ~8% toxicity reduction, 96% cohort graduation, GPAs). Persona alignment: excellent — content and vocabulary closely match a solutions-architect / ML-focused persona with concrete AWS and ML tooling (Bedrock, SageMaker, Glue, Athena) and relevant project descriptions. All three dimensions sit at the top end with no significant divergence in tone or emphasis, so the overall evaluation reflects strong alignment with the evaluation criteria.
Alignment: Checklist extracted: responsibilities include data integration, RPA/workflow development, BI reporting (SSRS & Power BI), SQL queries/stored procedures, SSIS package design, SFTP/production ops, APIs (REST/SOAP, JSON, XML), IIS/ASP.Net/.NET/C#, Okta API/Workato, SSAS, change management/testing, stakeholder collaboration, and minimum Master’s + 3 years. Comparison: explicit matches — Power BI, SSIS, general SQL, REST APIs, ETL/ELT and some quantified pipeline results; partial matches — SQL Server and JSON/XML are implied but not explicitly tied to SQLServer stored procedures or SOAP; missing — SSRS, SSAS, IIS, ASP.Net/.NET/C#, Visual Studio 2022, Okta API, Workato, SFTP operations, robotic process automation tools, formal change-management/process adherence, and required experience/degree timeline. Customization: resume contains no Touro University or Senior ETL & Data Analyst title or context (generic). Overall assessment: several relevant skills appear but many key required technologies, production ops responsibilities, and the company/title customization are missing, so a low-to-mid alignment score is warranted.
Impact: Strong presence of explicit, quantified results (1M+ records processed; 5× faster feedback loops; ~5% accuracy gain; ~8% toxicity reduction; 96% cohort graduation) across roles with clear timeframes (internship dates), satisfying the ≥2-metrics criterion. Language is action-oriented with verbs like Designed, Built, Automated, Fine-tuned, Developed, giving clear agency. Business impact ties to efficiency, quality, and retention, though no dollar/value or explicit cost savings are provided and a few metrics lack explicit baselines. Weighing metrics (high), action language (high), and business linkage (good but not monetary) yields a high score.
CredTail: High alignment: all personal-info (name, email Darwhin88@gmail.com, phone 347-491-2955, location New York, LinkedIn and GitHub URLs) match the Retrieval Context's Structured Profile personal_info. All employers, titles, and dates are verified against the Retrieval Context experience entries (Solutions Architect Intern at Amazon Web Services Jun 2025–Sep 2025; Software Developer Intern WOPLLI Jun 2024–Sep 2024; IT Support Intern Mayor’s Office Feb 2024–May 2024; IT Instructor Assistant RF CUNY & Generation USA Feb 2022–Aug 2023). Projects (Alfred) and technical details (FastAPI, OpenAI GPT-4 mini/GPT-4.1 mini, PostgreSQL/pgvector, RAG) are supported by the Retrieval Context projects entry. Education (MS Data Science expected Jan 2026; BS Jun 2024 with GPAs and honors) and certifications list match the Retrieval Context education and certifications arrays. No contradictions or fabricated employers/credentials found. Minor omission: a few core technologies present in the Retrieval Context (e.g., R Programming, Docker) are not listed in the Actual Output core competencies (treated as missing), so a small deduction was applied for incomplete core-technology coverage despite otherwise complete verification.",20,2025-12-18 15:17:50.980972,9,9

Tone: Professionalism rated 5/5 — polished, well-structured resume with full sections (summary, competencies, experience, projects, education, certs); only minor nit (""Postgre"" typo). Action-Oriented rated 5/5 — strong use of action verbs and quantified impacts (automated pipeline processing 1M+ records, 5× faster feedback loops; fine-tuned models improving accuracy ~5% and reducing toxicity ~8%). Persona Alignment rated 5/5 — consistent solutions-focused AWS/ML/data-engineer persona (Bedrock, SageMaker, Glue, RAG system in Alfred project, FastAPI/pgvector). No criterion differs by two or more points (no significant imbalance), and the Action-Oriented and Persona Alignment ratings logically support Professionalism. Average of the three criteria is 5.0 (rounded to one decimal) and scaled to a 0–10 range yields the top score.
Alignment: Matches: explicit Data Architecture, Data Modeling, Python, AWS (Glue present) and broad AWS tooling (Athena/Lambda/Glue/SageMaker/QuickSight), ETL/ELT experience, and concrete metrics (1M+ records pipeline, 5× faster feedback loops, +5% model accuracy, -8% toxicity). Partial matches: expert-level SQL (SQL listed but not evidenced as “expert”), data-engineering design patterns (pipelines/ETL noted but patterns not described), enterprise platform/leadership (architect work and POCs present but no senior/lead enterprise platform ownership). Missing: Snowflake and mandatory domain experience in Asset Management/Alternatives/Financial Services. Scoring: weighted match produced a mid-high base alignment (~6/10); resume lacks company/title tailoring so a negative specificity adjustment (-2) was applied, then a small positive adjustment (+1) for concrete named tools and quantified outcomes — final score is 5.
Impact: The output includes multiple action verbs paired with specific measurable results and business outcomes (e.g., automated a sentiment pipeline processing 1M+ records with 5× faster feedback loops; fine-tuned models improving accuracy ~5% and reducing toxicity ~8%; delivered 36 lessons to 200+ learners and maintained a 96% graduation rate), demonstrating clear metrics and impact. Shortcomings: several bullets remain vague or lack numeric/ROI context (e.g., “designed and presented reference architectures,” “built POCs” without quantified outcomes), so it falls short of an exceptional, fully contextualized impact statement.
CredTail: Strong match on key facts: both degrees and institutions (MS Data Science & ML at CUNY SPS expected Jan 2026; B.Tech Computer Information Systems at CUNY NYC College of Technology Jun 2024) and GPAs/honors are present and identical. All employers, job titles and dates match the Retrieval Context (AWS Solutions Architect Intern Jun 2025–Sep 2025; WOPLLI Software Developer Intern Jun 2024–Sep 2024; Mayor’s Office IT Support Feb 2024–May 2024; IT Instructor Assistant Feb 2022–Aug 2023). Core technologies and project details are largely supported (Python w/ pandas/scikit-learn/PyTorch; AWS services including Bedrock, Glue, SageMaker, QuickSight; Alfred project: FastAPI, PostgreSQL+pgvector, GPT-4.1 mini, Docker, CI/CD). Shortcomings: several core-skill items present in the Retrieval Context are omitted or only partially surfaced in the Actual Output (Azure services — App Service/Functions/Storage — are in Retrieval but not in Core Competencies; Security (SIEM, IDS), R Programming, explicit API/Containerization/Version Control entries are present in Retrieval but not in the Core Competencies list). Some experience highlights from the Retrieval Context (Mayor’s Office device refurbishment/ServiceNow asset tracking; additional WOPLLI highlights such as Postman/vendor management) are missing. No clear fabrications or contradictions found. Penalties applied: −1 for omitted notable core-skill entries (Azure/Security/R/APIs) and −1 for omitted experience highlights from Mayor’s Office/WOPLLI.

Tone: Professionalism=5: polished, formal tone and strong grammar with only minor first-person phrasing in the summary. Action-Oriented=5: uses strong action verbs and multiple quantified impacts (e.g., “processed 1M+ records,” “5× faster feedback loops,” “improved accuracy by ~5%,” “reduced time to apply by 60%”). Persona Alignment=5: clear fit for cloud/solutions-architect roles (AWS references: Bedrock, Athena/Glue/Lambda, SageMaker; OCI mention) and appropriate seniority for an internship/early-career cloud engineer. Average = 5.0 (no two category scores differ by more than 1), mapped to the 0–10 scale yields a top score.
Alignment: Strengths: clear technical matches for required tooling (Python and Java listed, substantial AWS and Azure experience, microservices and CI/CD, API integration) and multiple measurable outcomes (1M+ record pipeline, 5× faster feedback loops, model accuracy/toxicity metrics). Shortcomings: missing principal-level/technical leadership evidence, no datacenter automation or physical-asset lifecycle experience, no OCI/control-plane references, little demonstrated production operations/virtualization expertise. Evaluation notes: responsibilities match is limited (~40%), tools match is moderate (~75%), outcomes are present and strong; a 3-point penalty applied for being junior/generic and not tailored to Oracle/OCI specifics, yielding a low overall fit.
Impact: The output includes multiple clear, measurable accomplishments (e.g., automated sentiment pipeline processing 1M+ records with 5× faster feedback loops; fine-tuned models improving accuracy ~5% and reducing toxicity ~8%; Alfred project cutting time-to-apply by 60%; 96% cohort graduation rate, 36 lessons for 200+ learners; >100 VIP tickets handled). These are concrete, metric-driven results tied to operational impact. Shortcomings: the professional summary and several bullets remain high-level without business context (revenue/cost/customer impact) and some statements are generic, so I deducted points for remaining vagueness and occasional passive framing.
CredTail: Strong alignment: both degrees (M.S. Data Science & ML expected Jan 2026 with 4.0 GPA, Dean’s List 2x; B.Tech CIS Jun 2024 with 3.78 GPA, Dean’s List 5x, National Honor Society) appear in the retrieval context. All listed employers and employment dates for Solutions Architect Intern (AWS, Jun 2025–Sep 2025), Software Developer Intern (WOPLLI, Jun 2024–Sep 2024), IT Support Intern (Mayor’s Office, Feb 2024–May 2024), and IT Instructor Assistant (RF CUNY & Generation USA, Feb 2022–Aug 2023) match the retrieval context. Most core technologies and certifications claimed (AWS services including EC2/S3/Lambda/RDS/DynamoDB/Glue/SageMaker, Bedrock, QuickSight, Azure App Service/Functions, Python, R, SQL, AWS certs, Google certs) are supported by the retrieval context. Shortcomings: the resume lists Java as a core programming language but Java does not appear in the retrieval context (unsupported), and the Professional Summary’s statement about contributing to Oracle’s OCI team is not present in the retrieval context (unsupported/added). These two unsupported items constitute minor fabrications, so the output receives a slight deduction.",150,2025-12-18 19:20:20.003754,8,8

Tone: Professionalism 5/5 — clear, formal tone and polished grammar; well-structured sections and precise vocabulary (e.g., Certifications, Technical Expertise). Action-Oriented 5/5 — strong action verbs and multiple quantified outcomes (5× faster feedback, processing 1M records, 5% accuracy gain, 8% reduction in toxicity, 96% graduation rate). Persona Alignment 4/5 — excellent fit for cloud/AI solutions roles with relevant AWS/Azure/ML details, but voice and experience level skew slightly intern/early-career while the summary signals ambitions for Microsoft Cloud services (minor seniority/platform mismatch). Average = (5+5+4)/3 = 4.7 (no inconsistency flag — no two category scores differ by more than 1). Scaled to a 0–10 scale and rounded yields a final score of 9.
Alignment: Strengths: The resume demonstrates several required responsibilities—customer-focused AI work (automated sentiment-analysis pipeline processing >1M records, 5× faster feedback-to-action), model fine-tuning and ML experimentation (5% accuracy improvement, 8% reduction in hallucinations), cloud architecture and deployment experience (secure, scalable AWS and Azure environments, CI/CD, Docker), and data/visualization delivery (QuickSight dashboards). It also includes concrete outcomes/KPIs and measurable impacts, satisfying the outcomes step. Tools matched to the job include Azure, cloud/ML platforms, LLMs/Generative AI, Python, and RAG/pgvector, but the resume is AWS-heavy (Bedrock, SageMaker, QuickSight, Glue, Lambda) rather than Microsoft/Azure-centric. Shortcomings: limited explicit examples tied to Microsoft Cloud quality/security/reliability and sparse Microsoft-specific role-language; heavy AWS focus reduces tailoring to the Applied Scientist, Azure CXP role. I applied partial credit for matched responsibilities and strong measurable results, moderate credit for tool overlap, then subtracted two points for insufficient Microsoft/Azure tailoring and some generic/cloud-centric wording.
Impact: The resume contains clear, action-oriented accomplishments with quantifiable outcomes—e.g., processing over 1M feedback records, a 5× faster feedback-to-action turnaround, a 5% increase in model output accuracy, an 8% reduction in toxicity/hallucinations, and a 96% cohort graduation rate—meeting the evaluation’s emphasis on measurable results. Language is mostly active and tied to business-relevant impacts (feedback responsiveness, model quality). Minor deductions for limited baseline/context (no timeframe or revenue/ROI metrics) and occasional high-level summary phrasing that could be more specific about business impact.
CredTail: Nearly all degrees (M.S. Data Science & Machine Learning, B.Tech CIS), employers (AWS, WOPLLI, Mayor’s Office, RF CUNY & Generation), employment dates, certifications (AWS Solutions Architect – Associate, AWS AI Practitioner – Generative AI, Google Cybersecurity), project details (Alfred: FastAPI, PostgreSQL+pgvector, GPT-4.1 mini), and core AWS/Azure/ML technologies (Bedrock, SageMaker, Glue, Athena, QuickSight, Lambda, etc.) in the Actual Output are directly supported by the Retrieval Context. Deductions: the Actual Output omits one certification present in the context (Google Information Support Certificate) and the Cloud technical list drops Azure-specific items (though Azure appears elsewhere in the context), plus a minor meetup name variation (NYC HackR vs “NYHackR”). These are small omissions/variations rather than fabrications, so the score is reduced slightly.",155,2025-12-18 19:23:01.835146,9,9

Tone: Professionalism: rated highest due to formal tone, clear sectioning, and error-free grammar (Professional Summary, Education, Experience). Action-Oriented: strong use of action verbs and quantified impact throughout (e.g., “processed 1M+ records,” “5× faster feedback loops,” “~5% accuracy improvement,” “~8% toxicity reduction,” “60% reduced application time,” “96% cohort graduation rate”), so top marks. Persona Alignment: excellent fit for an early-career cloud/data/solutions role and tailored to Capital One with relevant AWS/ML projects and certifications. Average of the three category scores = 5.0, scaled to the 10-point output; no category discrepancy (no two scores differ by more than 1).
Alignment: Responsibilities: Resume shows strengths in innovation, solving complex problems, and collaborative/Agile delivery (3 of ~5 responsibility areas matched) but provides little concrete Android/product/UX work or role-specific mobile duties. Tools/technologies: only a few relevant items (Java, CI/CD/Agile) appear; key Android technologies (Kotlin, Android SDK/Jetpack, Android Studio) are missing, yielding a low tool-match. Outcomes/metrics: multiple measurable impacts are present (1M+ records processed, 5× faster feedback loops, ~5% model accuracy gain, 60% reduction in application time), but they are not tied to Android/mobile work. Penalization: resume is fairly generic and cloud/AI-focused rather than tailored to a Capital One Android engineer role, so a 2-point penalty is applied. Overall weighted total rounds to a score of 4.
Impact: Strong presence of action-oriented statements with clear, quantifiable outcomes (e.g., automated sentiment pipeline processing 1M+ records, 5× faster feedback loops, ~5% accuracy improvement and ~8% toxicity reduction, 60% reduced application time, 96% cohort graduation rate, 100+ support tickets). These metrics are tied to operational/business outcomes and use active phrasing, meeting the rubric’s high-specificity tier. Minor shortcomings: a few accomplishments lack context or explicit business impact (e.g., “Designed and presented secure, scalable AWS reference architectures” without metrics) and occasional vague descriptions, so a small penalty was applied.
CredTail: Following the retrieval-context check, most major claims are directly supported: name, email, phone, LinkedIn/GitHub links, location, both degrees (Master’s expected Jan 2026 and Bachelor Jun 2024) with GPAs and honors, all four internships with exact employers and dates, AWS/Azure services (EC2, S3, Lambda, RDS, DynamoDB, Glue, QuickSight, Bedrock, SageMaker), ETL/ELT (Glue, SSIS), data-visualization (QuickSight, Power BI), security items, the Alfred project (FastAPI, RAG, postgres/pgvector, CI/CD), and the listed certifications. Deductions were applied for multiple unsupported/fabricated core technologies listed in the Actual Output that do not appear in the structured retrieval context: Java, JavaScript, HTML, Dart, C#, and PHP.

Tone: Professionalism scored 5/5 — polished formal tone, correct grammar, clear formatting (header, summary, skills, education). Action-Oriented scored 5/5 — consistent use of strong verbs and quantified impact (e.g., automated pipeline processing 1M+ records, 5× faster feedback, ~5% accuracy gain, 8% toxicity reduction, 96% cohort graduation rate, 60% reduction in application time). Persona Alignment scored 5/5 — voice and content align well with a cloud-focused solutions architect/software engineering persona (AWS/Azure, SageMaker, Bedrock LLMs, microservices, internships at AWS). Average = 5.0; no two category scores differ by more than 1, so the evaluation is consistent.
Alignment: Responsibilities: Resume demonstrates several core responsibilities (designing/developing cloud services, REST APIs, debugging, cross-functional collaboration, mentoring via instructor role) — roughly a majority matched but lacks senior/Principal-level ownership and 6+ years of experience. Tools/technologies: Strong overlap with the JD (Python, PHP, Django/Flask/FastAPI, REST, MySQL/MongoDB, JavaScript, AWS/Azure, Docker, Git, CI/CD) though OCI and SOAP/CakePHP and explicit production performance-monitoring experience are missing. Outcomes/metrics: Includes measurable results (pipeline processing 1M+ records, 5× faster feedback loops, ~5% accuracy improvement, ~8% toxicity reduction, 96% cohort graduation, 60% reduced application time), showing some outcome alignment. Penalty applied for being junior/intern-heavy and not demonstrating enterprise Principal-level leadership/7+ years of applicable experience, yielding a mid-level match.
Impact: The resume contains multiple explicit, action-oriented results with clear metrics (e.g., automated sentiment pipeline processing 1M+ records and delivering 5× faster feedback loops; fine‑tuning in SageMaker improving accuracy ~5% and reducing toxicity ~8%; Alfred reducing application time by 60%; 96% cohort graduation rate; 100+ support tickets handled). These are measurable and tied to operational or user outcomes, and most language is active. A small deduction was applied because a few achievements remain vague or lack business-impact context (e.g., “designed and presented AWS reference architectures”) and a couple of passive/unsupported claims persist, so it’s not a perfectly metric-driven narrative.

Tone: Following the evaluation steps: Professionalism — the resume uses a formal, polished tone, correct grammar, consistent formatting, and clear sectioning. Action-Oriented — bullets use strong action verbs (Designed, Built, Automated, Fine-tuned, Developed, Delivered) and include measurable impacts (processed 1M+ records, 5× faster feedback loops, ~+5% accuracy, ~-8% toxicity, 96% cohort graduation, 800 devices refurbished, 100+ tickets). Persona Alignment — content and seniority align well with an early-career Solutions Architect/Data/ML persona (AWS Bedrock, SageMaker, Glue, LLMs, internship roles, MS in Data Science in progress). All three category ratings are consistently high with no two differing by more than one, indicating strong overall alignment.
Alignment: Step 1 (responsibilities): The resume demonstrates direct, role-specific Data Analyst responsibilities—data analysis, ETL/automated pipelines, data modeling, dashboarding, and ML/statistical analysis—matching the job’s data-focused expectations (matched all core responsibilities). Step 2 (tools/technologies): The resume explicitly lists and shows hands-on use of highly relevant tools/platforms (Python with pandas/Scikit, SQL/NoSQL, AWS services including Glue/Athena/SageMaker/QuickSight, Power BI, Docker, Git), aligning with the technical stack implied for Data Analyst/AI roles. Step 3 (outcomes/metrics): The candidate provides concrete metrics tied to work (automated pipeline processing 1M+ records, 5× faster feedback loops, ~5% model accuracy improvement, ~8% toxicity reduction, 96% cohort graduation rate), satisfying measurable outcomes. Penalization: the resume is tailored (mentions Hemma Systems Inc in the summary) and contains role-specific language, so no generic-resume penalty applied. Overall alignment is strong across responsibilities, tooling, and measurable outcomes.
Impact: Strong presence of action-oriented, measurable achievements supports a high score: multiple explicit metrics tie to business impact (automated pipeline processing 1M+ records and delivering 5× faster feedback loops; SageMaker fine-tuning improving accuracy ~5% and reducing toxicity ~8%; 96% cohort graduation rate; refurbished 800+ devices; delivered support on 100+ tickets). These are clear, quantifiable outcomes per step 1 and place the output in the upper rubric band. Points deducted for some vague/passive statements and missing context around business impact for certain bullets (e.g., “designed and presented” AWS architectures without impact metrics; “excellent service reviews” is non-specific), so I reduced the score slightly for passive/vague language per step 3.

Corrected fact: Dean's List (5x) per the provided context."").
Tone: The resume demonstrates very strong professionalism (formal tone, clean grammar, organized sections) and is highly action-oriented with quantified achievements (built a pipeline processing over 1M feedback records, enabled 5× faster feedback-to-action, achieved 5% accuracy improvement and 8% reduction in toxicity). Persona alignment with a cloud/AI architect role is excellent — concrete AWS/Azure tooling (Bedrock, SageMaker, Lambda, Glue, QuickSight), generative AI and architecture design examples support the target role and seniority. All evaluated categories are high and consistent (no two category ratings differ by more than one point), indicating strong overall alignment with the evaluation criteria.
Alignment: The resume demonstrates several core responsibilities: cloud architecture design and microservices/POC work are present (partial match for microservices and leadership), and Azure experience is listed (responsibility match ~50% → 2.5/5). Tools/platforms in the job (Azure, microservices/cloud) are explicitly present in the resume (full match → 2.5/2.5). Measurable outcomes are well-documented and tied to cloud/POC work (processing 1M records, 5× faster feedback-to-action, 5% accuracy gain, 8% toxicity reduction) (full match → 2.5/2.5). Penalized because the experience is AWS-heavy, largely intern-level, and lacks financial‑services domain and clear senior/leadership microservices duties (applied a 2-point penalty). Final rounded score reflects these strengths and shortcomings.
Impact: Strong presence of action-oriented, measurable results: e.g., a fully automated sentiment pipeline processing over 1M records with a 5× faster feedback-to-action turnaround, a 5% accuracy improvement and 8% reduction in toxicity from SageMaker finetuning, and a 96% cohort graduation rate from instruction — all directly tied to business or program outcomes.

Persona Alignment = 5: closely matches a Cloud Solutions Architect role and financial-services emphasis with relevant AWS/Azure skills (Bedrock, SageMaker, QuickSight) and AWS internship experience. Average = 5.0 → scaled to top score; no inconsistencies between category scores.
Alignment: Step 1 (responsibilities): Resume demonstrates several core responsibilities from the JD—designing secure, scalable cloud architectures, microservices experience, and domain relevance to financial services—however leadership/senior “lead” level is not clearly shown (intern roles); marked partial match → ~3/5. Step 2 (tools/technologies): Strong explicit overlap with cloud and platform tooling: Azure App Service/Functions/Storage, AWS services (EC2, S3, Lambda, RDS, Glue, SageMaker, Bedrock), Docker, CI/CD — high match rate → ~2.0/2.5. Step 3 (outcomes/metrics): Clear measurable outcomes tied to work (processed 1M records, 5× faster feedback-to-action, +5% model accuracy, −8% toxicity, 96% cohort graduation) → full credit → ~2.5/2.5. Step 4 (penalty): Resume is AWS-heavy, uses internship roles rather than senior/lead language despite JD seeking a Cloud Solutions Architect for Azure focus, so apply a 2-point penalty. Weighted sum rounds to a final score of 6.
Impact: Strong alignment with the rubric: the output contains multiple explicit, action-oriented accomplishments with concrete metrics and business impact (e.g., processing over 1M feedback records, enabling 5× faster feedback-to-action, 5% accuracy improvement, 8% reduction in toxicity, 96% cohort graduation rate). Language is largely active and metric-driven, satisfying steps 1–2. Minor shortcomings: a few metrics lack full context or baseline (how accuracy/toxicity improvements translate to business KPIs), so a small deduction for incomplete contextualization per step 3.
CredTail: Most items match the retrieval context: name, contact, employers and employment dates (AWS Jun 2025–Sep 2025, WOPLLI Jun 2024–Sep 2024, Mayor’s Office Feb 2024–May 2024, IT Instructor Feb 2022–Aug 2023), both degrees and their dates/GPA, and core AWS/Azure technologies (Bedrock, SageMaker, Glue, Lambda, QuickSight, EC2, S3, DynamoDB, etc.) are directly supported. Deductions applied for specific inconsistencies: the Bachelor’s Dean’s List count is contradicted (Actual lists 8x vs retrieval 5x — fabrication), Java is listed in Programming but does not appear in the retrieval context (unsupported), and the Master’s Dean’s List (2x) present in retrieval is omitted in the Actual Output (missing). These are minor but concrete mismatches, so the output is credible overall with small errors.",180,2025-12-18 19:36:58.703629,9,8

Tone: Professionalism scored 4/5 — resume uses a formal, consistent structure, clear grammar, and polished headings (Professional Summary, Education, Skills), though the ‘Senior’ claim slightly conflicts with listed experience. Action-Oriented scored 5/5 — strong action verbs and quantified impacts (e.g., “1M+ records,” “5× faster,” “improved accuracy by ~5%,” “96% cohort graduation rate”) demonstrate measurable results. Persona Alignment scored 3/5 — the stated “Senior Data Analyst with over 5 years” and healthcare specialization aren’t fully supported by the listed internships and recent degrees; healthcare-specific projects and senior-level responsibilities are limited. Average = 4.0/5 (mapped to an 8/10 overall). Note an inconsistency: Action-Oriented (5) vs Persona Alignment (3) differ by more than 1, indicating a mismatch between impact language and actual seniority/role evidence.
Alignment: Responsibilities: resume only demonstrates clear experience for ~3 of 7 listed responsibilities (navigation of ambiguity, creating/optimizing analytics pipelines/dashboards, and general pragmatic problem-solving) -> ~43% match (≈2.14/5). Tools/technologies: explicitly lists Python, SQL, Git, and data-visualization platforms (QuickSight, Power BI) and AWS analytics services (Glue/Athena) — 4 of 6 targeted items matched (~67% -> ≈1.67/2.5). Outcomes/metrics: some measurable results are present (1M+ records processed, 5× faster feedback loops, ML accuracy +5%, toxicity −8%), but only ~2 of 7 responsibility-areas have tied KPIs (~29% -> ≈0.71/2.5) and none are healthcare/member-experience KPIs. Major shortcomings: claims 5+ years of healthcare analytics but no healthcare roles or stakeholder-driven data-modeling projects, no UML/Kimball or explicit data warehouse/lakehouse design experience, and no documentation of mapping/source-to-model or standards work. Applied a 3-point penalty for lack of role/company-specific tailoring and missing core healthcare/data-modeling evidence. Final aggregated and rounded result reflects these matches and the penalty.
Impact: Strong presence of action-oriented, measurable outcomes: processed 1M+ records, 5× faster feedback loops, ~5% accuracy gain and ~8% toxicity reduction, 36 lessons for 200+ learners with a 96% graduation rate. Uses active verbs (built, automated, fine-tuned) and ties metrics to impact. Minor shortcomings: a few items lack exact context or business impact (e.g., “automated troubleshooting workflows” without a metric) and some approximations (~5%), so small penalty for occasional vagueness.
CredTail: Most factual items are directly supported by the retrieval: both education entries (M.S. Data Science & ML — CUNY SPS, Expected Jan 2026; B.Tech CIS — CUNY CityTech, Jun 2024 with GPAs and honors), the four listed internships and exact dates (AWS Solutions Architect Intern Jun 2025–Sep 2025; WOPLLI Jun 2024–Sep 2024; Mayor’s Office IT Support Feb 2024–May 2024; RF CUNY/Generation USA IT Instructor Assistant Feb 2022–Aug 2023), contact info and links, and certifications (AWS Solutions Architect, AWS AI Practitioner, Google Cybersecurity, Google Information Support). Core technologies cited in the Actual Output (Python/pandas, scikit-learn, SQL, AWS EC2/S3/Lambda/RDS/Glue, QuickSight, Azure App Service/Functions, Power BI, ML techniques) are present in the retrieval. Shortcomings: the summary’s claims are unsupported—calling the candidate a “Senior Data Analyst,” stating “over 5 years of experience in healthcare data analytics,” and naming Progyny are not in the retrieval (experience shown is internship roles 2022–2025). Minor omissions include some retrieval technologies (e.g., Bedrock, Macie, DynamoDB, SageMaker, PyTorch, FastAPI, Docker) that appear in the context but are not listed in the core skills section. Score reflects broadly accurate alignment with several significant unsupported assertions, hence a moderate penalty.",185,2025-12-18 19:39:50.749913,9,6

Tone: Professionalism: 5 — polished, formal tone with correct grammar and consistent formatting (clear header, education/certifications, concise bullets). Action-Oriented: 5 — strong action verbs and quantified impact throughout (e.g., “Automated a sentiment-analysis pipeline processing 1M+ records, improving feedback loops by 5x”; SageMaker accuracy +~5%, time-to-apply −60%, weekly applications +300%). Persona Alignment: 3 — technically focused voice fits tech roles, but summary’s claim of “extensive experience and team management” is inconsistent with mostly internship/early-career roles (AWS intern Jun–Sep 2025, WOPLLI Jun–Sep 2024, Master’s expected Jan 2026), so senior-level positioning is overstated. Average = 4.3. Inconsistency flagged: Professionalism and Persona Alignment differ by more than 1, indicating a mismatch between tone/skills and seniority claims.
Alignment: Responsibilities: resume only demonstrates a small subset of the manager duties (subject-matter expertise in ML/cloud, participation in technical design, and remote work), so few of the listed 13 responsibilities are clearly matched (low responsibility match → small share of the 0–5 points). Tools/technologies: explicit overlaps include Python, Java, JavaScript and distributed systems/microservices/AWS components, covering several but not the full set of 11+ tools called out (moderate match → modest share of the 0–2.5 points). Outcomes/metrics: strong — multiple measurable results are provided (1M+ record pipeline, ~5% accuracy gain and ~8% toxicity reduction, 60% time reduction and 300% increase in applications, 96% graduation rate), earning a high share of the 0–2.5 points. Penalization: resume reads generic for a Software Engineering Manager role and lacks concrete management/recruiting/org-design evidence (mostly internship-level and project-level experience), so the 2–3 point penalty applies. Combined weighted points and penalty yield a very low final rating after rounding.
Impact: The output contains multiple clear, action-oriented results with quantifiable metrics tied to impact (e.g., automated sentiment pipeline processing 1M+ records and improving feedback loops by 5x; SageMaker tuning improving accuracy ~5% and reducing toxicity ~8%; Alfred project cutting apply time by 60% and increasing weekly applications by 300%; 36 lessons for 200+ learners with a 96% graduation rate; 100+ support tickets handled). These are specific and business-relevant. Minor shortcomings: a few items remain vague or lack context/impact (e.g., “reducing manual workload” without a metric) and occasional passive phrasing, so a small penalty was applied.
CredTail: Most items are directly supported by the retrieval context: both degrees (MS Data Science & ML — Expected Jan 2026 with 4.0 GPA, and BTech CIS — Jun 2024 with 3.78 GPA and honors), all four employers and their dates (AWS Jun 2025–Sep 2025, WOPLLI Jun 2024–Sep 2024, Mayor’s Office Feb 2024–May 2024, RF CUNY & Generation Feb 2022–Aug 2023), certifications, project (Alfred with FastAPI + OpenAI GPT-4 Mini), and many technologies (Python, SQL/NoSQL, JavaScript/Java via artifacts, AWS services including EC2/S3/Lambda/RDS, SageMaker, scikit-learn, PyTorch, Azure) match exactly. One minor mismatch: “Distributed Systems” (listed under Infrastructure) does not appear verbatim in the retrieval context (microservices and related infrastructure are present). No major fabrications detected. Deduction applied for that missing technology phrase, yielding a score reflecting minor omissions.",190,2025-12-18 19:43:31.455109,9,8

Action-Oriented: 5/5 — uses strong action verbs and quantified results (e.g., “1M+ records,” “5× faster feedback loops,” “~5% accuracy improvement,” “~8% toxicity reduction,” “96% cohort graduation”). Persona Alignment: 5/5 — tone and content strongly match a cloud/data-focused solutions architect/data-science persona (AWS services, Bedrock/SageMaker, QuickSight, data pipelines). Average: 5.0/5.0. Relative differences: all three categories are equal (no single highest or lowest). Minor improvement: could add higher-level business impact (cost saved or revenue uplift) to further strengthen senior-impact framing.
Alignment: Evaluation based on extracted Android role requirements (Android development skills and toolchain, mobile app projects, UI/UX/Android SDK, Kotlin, Jetpack/Compose, testing/CI, REST/API integration, Agile collaboration, measurable outcomes). Matches/paraphrases: • Close paraphrase: Java and XML are listed (related to Android but not explicit Android/Android Studio/Kotlin experience). • Direct matches: REST APIs/Postman, Agile/Scrum, Git/version control, collaboration skills. • Present but not relevant: strong AWS/ML/data pipeline experience with quantified outcomes (1M+ records, 5× faster feedback loops) which shows specificity but is outside Android scope. Missing: explicit Android development experience (Android SDK, Android Studio), Kotlin, Jetpack/Compose, mobile app projects, UI/UX work, Android testing/instrumentation, CI/CD for mobile, and finance/Capital One tailoring. The resume provides good quantified achievements in cloud/ML but lacks the core platform skills and project evidence required for an Android Software Engineer role, so credit is low overall.
Impact: Strong presence of action verbs plus multiple clear, quantifiable results: automated sentiment pipeline processing 1M+ records with 5× faster feedback loops; fine-tuned models improving accuracy ~5% and reducing toxicity ~8%; delivery metrics (36 lessons for 200+ learners, 96% graduation rate, 100+ tickets). Metrics tie to efficiency, accuracy, and customer outcomes. Deducted for several vague or passive bullets that lack measurable outcomes (e.g., “Designed and presented secure…,” “Managed relations with 3rd‑party vendors,” “Developed API integration…”), which prevents a perfect rating.
CredTail: Education fully VERIFIED: both degrees, dates (Master expected Jan 2026; B.Tech Jun 2024), GPAs and honors match the Retrieval Context.

Core Skills are partially VERIFIED (Python, SQL, AWS components including Glue/QuickSight/Bedrock/SageMaker, Azure App Service/Functions, APIs/ FastAPI/Postman/Swagger, ETL/ELT, data modeling) but many claimed programming/language items are MISSING from the Retrieval Context and treated as fabrications: Java, JavaScript, HTML, XML, Dart, C#, PHP, plus the explicit “Excellent verbal and written communication / customer service” entry. Based on category subscores (Education and Experience fully verified; Core Skills only ~58% verified then strongly penalized for multiple missing items), the aggregate credibility is high for education/experience but reduced by core-skills fabrications—those missing programming-language claims and collaboration phrasing drove the downgrade.",158,2025-12-18 19:20:51.922982,9,8

Tone: Professionalism: scored 5 for a consistent, formal, error-free resume with clear headings and industry-appropriate language. Action-Oriented: scored 5 for frequent strong verbs and quantified achievements (e.g., automated pipeline processing 1M+ records, 5× faster feedback loops, ~5% accuracy improvement, 8% toxicity reduction, 96% cohort graduation). Persona Alignment: scored 5 because tone and content closely match a solutions-architect/data-science intern persona with AWS, SageMaker, Bedrock, Glue, QuickSight experience. Average = (5+5+5)/3 = 5.0 (highest=lowest=5), scaled to a 0–10 metric = 10.
Alignment: Followed the evaluation steps: I extracted key JD items (seniority/principal leadership, 6+ years, BS/MS, Python/PHP, REST/SOAP, Django/Flask, MySQL/MongoDB/NoSQL, client/server JS, cloud (OCI/AWS/Azure), container/cloud-native, Git/CI-CD, server-side performance monitoring/logging, security/high-availability). Matches: Python, PHP, Django/Flask, REST APIs, MySQL/MongoDB/DynamoDB, JavaScript, AWS/Azure, Git/Docker and CI/CD (direct or close paraphrase) and explicit quantified outcomes (1M+ records pipeline, 5× faster dashboards, model improvements) — these are strengths. Partial/paraphrase: cloud-native architecture and secure, scalable design are claimed (AWS reference architectures) but limited enterprise/principal-level evidence. Missing or weak: required seniority (6–7+ years and Principal-level leadership/mentorship), explicit OCI experience, explicit server-side performance monitoring/logging and DevOps pipeline automation details for production-grade operations. Overall many technical tools match, but the large gap in seniority/leadership and lack of OCI/monitoring evidence are significant for a Principal role, so I assigned a low-medium score reflecting strong technical/tool alignment but critical experience/responsibility mismatches.
Impact: Strong use of action verbs and multiple clear, business-relevant metrics (e.g., automated sentiment pipeline processing 1M+ records with 5× faster feedback loops; fine-tuned SageMaker models improving accuracy ~5% and reducing toxicity ~8%; maintained a 96% graduation rate; delivered 36 lessons to 200+ learners; handled 100+ white-glove tickets). These show measurable outcomes tied to efficiency, model performance, and customer/education outcomes. Points subtracted for several bullets that remain vague or lack quantification (e.g., ‘designed and presented AWS reference architectures’, ‘automated troubleshooting workflows…to reduce manual workload’) and for a few metrics missing baselines/timeframes. Overall the resume demonstrates strong quantifiable impact but is not uniformly specific across all bullets.
CredTail: Education: Both degrees (CUNY SPS MS expected Jan 2026, CUNY NYCCT B.Tech Jun 2024) with GPAs and honors are present in the retrieval context — VERIFIED (Education subscore 10/10).

Core Skills: Many technical claims are VERIFIED (Python, SQL, AWS services EC2/S3/Lambda/RDS/DynamoDB, Azure App Service/Functions, REST, MySQL, PostgreSQL, MongoDB, Git, Docker, Agile/Scrum — ~16 of 26 listed items). Missing/fabricated or unverified items: Java, JavaScript, PHP, Django, Flask, SOAP, explicit “Full-stack development”, and the listed soft skills (strong written/oral communication, leadership, relationship building) are not present in the retrieval context. I applied a strong penalty for these fabrications/missing items, reducing the Core Skills subscore from ~6/10 to 3/10. Aggregating Education (10), Experience (10) and Core Skills (3) yields an overall credibility score of 8/10. Key determinants: complete match on education and experience (raised score) and multiple absent/unsupported core-skill claims (penalized).",163,2025-12-18 19:23:39.701898,9,8

Alignment: Extracted requirements: Data Analyst skills (SQL, BI/visualization, Python/R), cloud/ETL (AWS Glue/Athena/Lambda), dashboards/analytics, measurable outcomes, and applicant tailoring for U.S. roles. Actual output direct matches: SQL, QuickSight, Power BI, Python (pandas), R, AWS (Glue/Athena/Lambda/EC2/S3), ETL/automated pipelines, real-time dashboards, and quantified results (1M+ records processed, 5× faster, ~5% accuracy gain, 8% toxicity reduction) — concrete project evidence and named tools are present. Paraphrase/partial matches: generative AI/LLMs and SageMaker fine‑tuning align with ML/data-science expectations. Missing/weak: no explicit “Data Analyst” job title or Hemma Systems tailoring, no mention of OPT/STEM/work-authorization context from the posting, and minimal mention of common analyst staples like Excel/Tableau. Given a high match rate of core technical tools and quantified outcomes but penalized for lack of role/company tailoring and immigration/job-program signals, the resume aligns strongly but not perfectly with the posting.
Impact: Several bullets include strong action verbs with specific metrics tied to business impact (e.g., automated sentiment pipeline processing 1M+ records with 5× faster feedback loops; fine-tuned models improving accuracy ~5% and reducing toxicity ~8%; delivered 36 lessons to 200+ learners and maintained a 96% graduation rate). These demonstrate measurable efficiency and performance gains. However, some entries are unquantified or vague (e.g., “Designed and presented secure, scalable AWS reference architectures,” “Automated troubleshooting workflows…to reduce manual workload”), and a few metrics lack clear baselines or timeframes, so points were deducted for inconsistent quantification and occasional passive/unclear language.
CredTail: Education: all claims VERIFIED — Master of Science (CUNY SPS, expected Jan 2026, GPA 4.0, Dean’s List 2x) and Bachelor (CUNY NYC College of Technology, Jun 2024, GPA 3.78, Dean’s List 5x, National Honor Society) match the Retrieval Context.

Action-Oriented: 5/5 — frequent strong verbs and quantified outcomes (e.g., built a pipeline processing over 1M feedback records, enabled 5× faster feedback-to-action turnaround; 96% cohort graduation rate; 36 lessons for 200+ learners). Persona Alignment: 5/5 — tone, skills (AWS, Bedrock, Lambda, QuickSight, RAG, CI/CD) and resume framing match a Solutions Architect / data/AI candidate. Average = 5.0/5 (all categories equal; no single weakest area). Minor shortcoming: a few bullets (WOPLLI, some internship lines) could use additional quantified impact or more specific metrics, but overall the output strongly meets the evaluation criteria.
Alignment: Match summary based on the job request to ‘lead cloud solutions and microservices’ for an Azure-focused Cloud Solutions Architect at a financial-services client: Direct matches — Azure technologies listed (App Service, Functions, Storage) and Microservices Architecture are present; CI/CD and Docker, security (Active Directory, SIEM/IDS), and quantified project results (built a pipeline processing 1M records with 5× faster feedback) are explicit. Close/paraphrase — Azure hands‑on experience is limited to a Software Developer Intern entry that “configured and tested Azure environments” (paraphrase rather than demonstrated Azure architecture leadership); microservices leadership is claimed but mostly supported by internships and projects rather than senior architect experience. Missing or weak — no explicit financial services domain experience, no Azure certifications (only AWS certs), and limited evidence of leading cloud teams or large-scale Azure migrations. Specificity is good (quantified outcomes and a concrete agentic project), but heavy AWS emphasis and lack of domain/senior Azure credentials reduce fit. Combining match rate, specificity, and penalties yields a moderate alignment score.
Impact: Strong use of action verbs with several clear, quantifiable outcomes: e.g., “built and deployed…processing over 1M feedback records” and “enabling 5× faster feedback-to-action,” plus “36 lessons for 200+ learners” and a “96% cohort graduation rate,” which demonstrate measurable impact (steps 1–2,4).

Action-Oriented: top-tier — frequent strong verbs and quantified accomplishments (processed >1M feedback records, enabled 5× faster feedback-to-action, 96% cohort graduation, built/deployed POCs, CI/CD). Persona Alignment: top-tier — content and tone align with a solutions-architect/data-science intern (AWS services, Bedrock, QuickSight, FastAPI + GPT project, pgvector).

Alignment: Extracted checklist: Azure expertise, cloud solutions architect leadership, microservices architecture (containers/K8s/AKS), Azure-native tools (App Service, Functions, Storage, DevOps), CI/CD & automation, security/governance, financial-services domain, quantified outcomes. Matches: Azure services (App Service, Functions, Storage) — direct match; CI/CD & automation (Docker, CI/CD pipeline in project) — direct match; Security (SIEM, IDS, Active Directory) — close match; Microservices architecture — listed as core skill (paraphrase) but no concrete production microservices or AKS/Kubernetes evidence (partial); Cloud Solutions Architect experience — intern-level AWS Solutions Architect role (paraphrase/partial, not senior/lead Azure architect); Azure tooling coverage is incomplete (Azure DevOps, AKS missing) — no mention; Financial services domain experience — missing. Resume shows strong AWS/Generative AI focus and good quantified outcome (1M records, 5× faster), which raises specificity credit, but lacks senior/lead cloud architecture and domain alignment to the Azure financial-services role. Overall: moderate match of technical skills and strong measurable project outcome, but missing key Azure-native deployment/leadership and industry experience — score reflects these strengths and gaps.
Impact: Strong presence of action verbs with multiple clear, quantifiable outcomes: e.g., “Built and deployed…processing over 1M feedback records” and “5× faster feedback-to-action turnaround,” plus “36 lessons for 200+ learners” and a “96% cohort graduation rate.” Those metrics are concrete and tied to efficiency and customer/learner outcomes, which aligns with Steps 1–2 and 4. Points deducted because several bullets remain vague or lack measurable results (e.g., “Designed and presented secure, scalable AWS architectures,” “Developed proof-of-concept solutions”) and a few metrics lack explicit baselines/timeframes or direct revenue/cost context, so passive/ambiguous language and limited business-impact framing reduce perfect alignment.

Alignment: Matches: Python and SQL present; data visualization tools (QuickSight, Power BI) and concrete, quantified project outcomes (automated pipeline processing 1M+ records, 5x faster feedback loops, ~5% accuracy improvement) demonstrate specificity. Paraphrased/partial: data modeling expertise claimed in Core Skills and summary and stakeholder translation experience implied in projects. Missing/no mention: required 5+ years of healthcare data & analytics and 5+ years of data modeling (candidate is internship-level with 2024–2025 roles), explicit Git experience, UML/Kimball/data warehouse design mention, and cross-system source-to-model mapping or query-profiling/optimization practice. Location/authorization satisfied (New York, NY). Overall score reflects decent technical project evidence but major gaps on seniority, healthcare domain depth, and explicit enterprise modeling/warehouse experience.
Impact: High presence of active verbs with multiple specific, measurable outcomes: e.g., ‘automated a sentiment-analysis pipeline processing 1M+ records’ and ‘enhancing feedback loops by 5x’, ‘improved accuracy ~5% and reduced toxicity ~8%’, ‘36 lessons for 200+ learners with a 96% graduation rate’, and ‘white glove support on over 100 tickets’ — these are clear action+metric instances (Step 1–2). Metrics are relevant to throughput, model quality, and user outcomes (Step 4). Score is slightly reduced because several bullets remain vague or unquantified (e.g., “Designed and presented secure, scalable AWS reference architectures,” “Built POCs…,” “Automated troubleshooting workflows…significantly reducing manual workload” and “enhancing data accessibility”), and some passive/ambiguous phrasing appears (Step 3). Overall strong quantification and business relevance but not uniformly applied across all bullets.
CredTail: Following the evaluation steps: Education — both degrees, dates, GPAs, and honors in the Actual Output exactly match the Retrieval Context (2/2 items VERIFIED) → Education subscore 10. Experience — all four roles, employers, locations, dates, and listed highlights match the Retrieval Context (4/4 VERIFIED) → Experience subscore 10. Core Skills — most technical claims are VERIFIED (Python with pandas/scikit-learn, SQL, AWS components Glue/RDS/Bedrock/SageMaker, Azure, QuickSight/Power BI, ETL/ELT, Agile) but two claims are not present in the Retrieval Context: explicit “healthcare data analytics” and an explicit “Communication & Collaboration” bullet (labeled MISSING → treated as fabricated per instructions). Out of 4 core-skill bullets 3 are VERIFIED (75% → raw ~7.5/10) but a strong penalty for the missing/fabricated items reduces the Core Skills subscore (applied here to 5/10). Aggregating Education (10), Experience (10), Core Skills (5) and applying the fabrication penalty yields a final credibility score of 8. Fabricated/missing items explicitly: healthcare data analytics; explicit Communication & Collaboration claim. The decisive factors were fully-verified education and experience versus the missing core-skill claims, which triggered the penalty and lowered the overall credibility.",183,2025-12-18 19:34:05.959156,9,8
95,1066,P1,10,10,4,42,"Punctuality: The score is 1.00 because the contradictions list is empty, indicating the actual output fully aligns with the retrieval context — nicely done!
Tone: Professionalism: 5 — formal, polished resume with clear headings, contact links (LinkedIn/GitHub), and few/no errors. Action-Oriented: 5 — frequent strong verbs and quantified outcomes (1M+ records processed, 5× faster feedback loops, ~5% accuracy improvement, ~8% toxicity reduction, 96% cohort graduation rate). Persona Alignment: 5 — tone, skills, and projects (AWS architectures, Bedrock/SageMaker POCs, cloud certifications) align well with a solutions-architect/data-science early-career candidate. Average = 5.0/5, scaled to the requested 0–10 range = 10; all sub-scores are equal (no relative differences).
Alignment: Following the evaluation steps, I extracted key requirements (managerial leadership, hands‑on coding in C++/Java/JS/Python/PHP, subject‑matter expertise, infrastructure/core components, large‑scale/distributed systems and scaling, recruiting/performance management, cross‑functional coordination, roadmap/strategy, technical design, measurable impact, and minimum quals: Master’s + 3 years). Direct matches: programming languages (Python, Java, JavaScript, PHP) and named AWS services/architectures; quantified technical outcomes (pipeline processing 1M+ records, 5× faster feedback loops, model accuracy/toxicity deltas, 96% cohort grad) show specificity. Close/paraphrase: hands‑on coding and architecture work (intern roles & AWS reference architectures) and cross‑functional/vendor coordination. Missing or weak: demonstrated people management (recruiting, performance management, managing managers, org design), explicit experience building large‑scale Internet architectures (CDN/LAMP/load balancing), distributed systems/cache/storage design, scaling high‑throughput systems, and coordinating large multi‑team efforts. Also fails minimum qualifications: Master’s not yet completed and overall work experience appears internship‑heavy (insufficient 3 years). Because of solid technical matches and quantified results but critical gaps in management, large‑scale systems experience, and minimum quals, the resume partially aligns with the job — awarding a mid‑low score.
Impact: Strong presence of action verbs with multiple clear, quantifiable outcomes (e.g., automated sentiment pipeline processing 1M+ records and delivering 5× faster feedback loops; fine-tuned models improving accuracy ~5% and reducing toxicity ~8%; 36 lessons for 200+ learners and a 96% cohort graduation rate). Metrics are relevant to efficiency, model quality, and learner outcomes. Deductions for several bullets that lack measurable results or business context (Software Developer and some IT Support items), and a few vague phrases like “excellent service reviews” or no baselines/timeframes for some improvements. Overall highly metric-driven with minor gaps in consistency and specificity.
CredTail: Step 1: I compared each claim to the Retrieval Context. Education: both degrees and honors (M.S. Data Science & ML — Expected Jan 2026, GPA 4.0, Dean’s List 2x; B.Tech CIS — Jun 2024, GPA 3.78, Dean’s List 5x, National Honor Society) are VERIFIED. Experience: all four roles and dates (Solutions Architect Intern at AWS Jun 2025–Sep 2025; Software Developer Intern WOPLLI Jun 2024–Sep 2024; IT Support Intern Mayor’s Office Feb 2024–May 2024; IT Instructor Assistant RF CUNY Feb 2022–Aug 2023) and their listed highlights are VERIFIED. Core Skills: nearly all listed technologies and domains are VERIFIED against core_skills (Python w/ pandas, scikit-learn, seaborn, PyTorch; SQL/NoSQL; AWS services including EC2/S3/Lambda/RDS/DynamoDB/Glue/QuickSight/Bedrock/SageMaker; Azure App Service/Functions; ETL Glue/SSIS; SIEM/IDS/Active Directory/Linux; Agile/SDLC/Microservices/CI-CD, etc.). One claim is MISSING from the Retrieval Context: PHP (listed under Programming Languages in the Actual Output is not present in the structured profile or artifacts). No claims were CONTRADICTED. Step 2–3: Education subscore: 10/10 (2/2 verified). Experience subscore: 10/10 (4/4 verified). Core Skills: base subscore high (≈9/10) but per instructions a missing/ fabricated item triggers a strong penalty — I reduced the core-skills subscore to 7/10 and explicitly list the missing item: PHP (fabricated/missing). Aggregate (10+10+7)/3 ≈ 9 → final credibility score reflects near-complete verification with a single missing core-skill claim (PHP) that produced a penalty and therefore a slightly reduced overall rating.",188,2025-12-18 19:36:48.634567,9,9
102,1162,P1,10,10,3,40,"Punctuality: The score is 1.00 because there are no contradictions in the provided list, so the actual output fully aligns with the retrieval context — great job!
Tone: Professionalism 5, Action-Oriented 5, Persona Alignment 5 → average 5.0 (scaled to 10). The resume is formal and error-free with industry-appropriate structure and tone. It uses strong action verbs and quantified achievements (e.g., designed AWS reference architectures; built Bedrock+Athena/Glue/Lambda POCs; automated a sentiment pipeline processing 1M+ records and delivering 5× faster feedback loops; SageMaker fine-tuning improving accuracy ~5% and reducing toxicity ~8%). Tone and content align closely with a Solutions Architect/technical intern persona. No significant shortcomings identified against the evaluation criteria; all sub-scores are equal and maximal.
Alignment: Following the evaluation steps: required items include Android mobile development (Android SDK, Kotlin, Jetpack), leadership/lead engineer experience on mobile teams, mobile app delivery with measurable outcomes, testing/CI for Android, and collaboration/Agile. Resume matches/mentions: Java (direct match), Dart (direct mention — implies Flutter/mobile but not explicitly tied to Android projects), CI/CD and Agile (direct matches), cloud/integration experience and quantified AWS results (strong specificity but not mobile). Paraphrases: “Proven ability to lead projects” (close paraphrase of leadership but no Lead title or team/mentoring details). Missing: explicit Android technologies (Kotlin, Android SDK/Jetpack), Android app projects or app-store delivery, Android-specific testing frameworks, and a Lead Software Engineer title. Because only a few transferable skills are present (Java, Dart, CI/CD, Agile) and strong evidence is for cloud/ML rather than Android, and the resume lacks Android-specific artifacts and a lead engineering role, the combined match rate and specificity justify a low score.
Impact: Strong use of action verbs with multiple clear, measurable results: e.g., automated sentiment pipeline processing 1M+ records with 5× faster feedback loops, SageMaker tuning improving accuracy ~5% and reducing toxicity ~8%, 36 lessons for 200+ learners with a 96% graduation rate, and 100+ tickets supported. These are relevant to efficiency, model quality, and customer outcomes, and there are several distinct quantifiable metrics. Minor shortcomings: a few bullets are vague or lack magnitude/baseline (e.g., “Designed and presented secure, scalable AWS reference architectures,” “Built POCs…” and “Automated troubleshooting workflows…reduce manual workload”), so small deductions for inconsistent metric coverage.
CredTail: Education: VERIFIED — both degrees (MS expected Jan 2026, GPA 4.0; B.Tech Jun 2024, GPA 3.78) and honors appear in the Retrieval Context. Experience: VERIFIED — all four roles (Solutions Architect Intern at AWS Jun 2025–Sep 2025; Software Developer Intern WOPLLI Jun 2024–Sep 2024; IT Support Intern Mayor’s Office Feb 2024–May 2024; IT Instructor Assistant Feb 2022–Aug 2023) and associated highlights/dates match the Retrieval Context. Core Skills: PARTIAL — many items are VERIFIED (AWS services including EC2/S3/Lambda/RDS/DynamoDB, Glue, QuickSight, Bedrock, SageMaker; Azure App Service/Functions; ETL/ELT, Data Modeling, Power BI; PostgreSQL/MySQL/Oracle/MongoDB/DynamoDB; REST/FastAPI/Docker; SIEM/Active Directory; CI/CD/Agile/SDLC). Missing/fabricated items (absent from Retrieval Context) include several programming languages and the soft-skills bullet: JavaScript, HTML, Dart, C#, PHP, (Java is not consistently present in the structured core_skills), and the explicit “Excellent communication, collaboration, problem-solving, customer service” soft-skills list. Scoring: Education subscore 10/10 (2/2 verified). Experience subscore 10/10 (4/4 verified). Core Skills raw proportion verified ≈72% → ~7/10, but a strong penalty applied for multiple missing/fabricated language and soft-skill claims reduces this to 4/10. Aggregated (10+10+4)/3 → final credibility score 8/10. Determining factors: perfect alignment on education and experience raised the rating; missing programming-language claims and absent soft-skills wording in the Retrieval Context were the primary deductions (explicitly listed above).",193,2025-12-18 19:39:55.272253,9,8

Tone: Professionalism 5 — consistently formal, well-structured, and error-free tone (clear headings, correct punctuation). Action-Oriented 5 — frequent strong action verbs and quantified achievements (e.g., built/deployed pipeline processing over 1M records, 5× faster feedback-to-action, 5% accuracy gain, 8% reduction in toxicity, 60% time reduction and 300% increase in applications). Persona Alignment 5 — tone and content clearly match a cloud/AI solutions architect/data-science persona with concrete AWS/Bedrock/SageMaker/QuickSight experience. Average = (5+5+5)/3 = 5.0 (highest and lowest scores are equal at 5), scaled to the 0–10 output range = 10.
Alignment: Extracted requirements: design/implement/manage cloud solutions; collaborate with stakeholders; develop/deploy scalable, secure cloud architectures; integrate Azure services with existing systems; lead migration of on‑prem workloads to cloud. Matches: designing cloud architectures — direct match (AWS Solutions Architect internship, POC architectures); implementing/managing cloud solutions — direct match (built automated pipelines, deployed solutions, cost analysis); collaboration with stakeholders — close/direct match (designed and presented to enterprise clients); scalable/secure deployments — direct match (secure, scalable AWS architectures; QuickSight real‑time dashboards); integration of Azure services — close paraphrase (configured and tested Azure environments, but only one line and no deep Azure services named); lead migration of on‑prem workloads — missing (no explicit on‑prem → cloud migration projects or leadership). Tools: strong named AWS stack (EC2, S3, Lambda, Glue, QuickSight, Bedrock, SageMaker) and certifications; minimal Azure evidence. Specificity/evidence: resume includes strong quantified outcomes (1M records processed, 5× faster feedback loop, 5% accuracy gain, 8% toxicity reduction, 60% time reduction, 300% application increase), concrete projects and CI/CD — earns credit. Penalties: not tailored to Dickinson’s explicit Azure/migration needs and lacks explicit migration leadership. Combining high match rate and strong quantitative evidence but missing key Azure/migration items yields a score toward the higher end.
Impact: Strong use of action verbs and numerous specific, quantifiable outcomes: e.g., built a pipeline processing over 1M feedback records enabling a 5× faster feedback-to-action turnaround; fine-tuned models with a 5% accuracy uplift and 8% reduction in toxicity/hallucinations; reduced job-application time 60% and increased completed applications 300%; delivered 36 lessons to 200+ learners with a 96% graduation rate. Multiple distinct, business-relevant metrics (efficiency, accuracy, throughput) earn high marks. Minor shortcomings: a few bullets lack baselines/timeframes or explicit business impact (e.g., “Performed cost analysis” with no result) and occasional mildly passive phrasing, so not perfect.
CredTail: Systematically compared claims to the Retrieval Context. Education: Master’s degree (CUNY SPS, MS Data Science & ML, expected Jan 2026, GPA 4.0) is VERIFIED; Bachelor’s degree (CUNY NYCCT, B.Tech CIS, Jun 2024, GPA 3.78, National Honor Society) is VERIFIED but the Bachelor’s Dean’s List count in the Actual Output (8×) is CONTRADICTED by the Retrieval Context (5×). Education subscore: 7/10 (most items verified; strong penalty applied for the contradicted Dean’s List claim). Experience: all four roles, employers, dates, and highlighted accomplishments (AWS Solutions Architect Intern Jun 2025–Sep 2025; Software Developer Intern WOPLLI Jun 2024–Sep 2024; IT Support Intern Mayor’s Office Feb 2024–May 2024; IT Instructor Assistant Feb 2022–Aug 2023) are VERIFIED and align closely with the context. Experience subscore: 10/10. Core Skills / Projects / Certifications: major cloud, ML, data and project claims (AWS services including Bedrock/SageMaker, Python/pandas/scikit-learn/PyTorch, FastAPI + PostgreSQL+pgvector, OpenAI GPT-4.1 mini, Docker, CI/CD, and listed certifications) are VERIFIED; one item (Tableau in Visualization) appears in the Actual Output but is MISSING from the Retrieval Context and is therefore treated as a fabrication/missing claim. Core Skills subscore: 7/10 (penalized for the missing Tableau claim). Fabricated/missing/contradicted items explicitly: Bachelor’s Dean’s List (Actual: 8× — Retrieval: 5×) and Tableau (listed in Technical Expertise in Actual, not present in Retrieval Context). Aggregate: the high-confidence, fully-verified experience section and mostly-verified education and skills produce a strong overall credibility profile, with the two noted contradictions/missing items driving the applied penalties.",198,2025-12-18 19:43:33.492653,9,8

Tone: Professionalism: very high—clean formatting, clear headings, correct grammar, and concise summary. Action-oriented: strong use of action verbs and quantified outcomes (e.g., automated sentiment pipeline processing 1M+ records with 5× faster feedback loops; SageMaker improvements of +5% accuracy/-8% toxicity; restored 400+ devices; 96% cohort graduation; Alfred reduced application time by 60% and increased applications 300%). Persona alignment: excellent fit for cloud/solutions-architect roles with AWS, SageMaker, CI/CD, security skills and relevant internships/certifications. Scores are consistent (no notable gaps across the three criteria).
Alignment: The resume partially matches the JD. Strengths: it explicitly lists .NET and API work (Core Skills: .NET; APIs: REST, FastAPI), cloud and automation tooling (AWS, Azure, CI/CD), and includes concrete metrics (1M+ record pipeline with 5× speedup; 60% application-time reduction; 5%/8% model improvements), which earns credit for tools and measurable outcomes. Shortcomings: it does not show the required 8 years of experience (candidate has internship roles and an expected MS in 2026), omits any accounting-vertical experience, and lacks evidence of technical oversight/leading a team or explicit custom application design for enterprise accounting—key responsibilities in the JD. Overall, good tooling and metrics but missing critical seniority, domain (accounting), and leadership alignment, so moderate fit.
Impact: Most bullets include an action verb + measurable result + clear business outcome (examples: automated sentiment-analysis pipeline processing 1M+ records with 5× faster feedback loops; fine-tuned SageMaker models improving accuracy by 5% and reducing toxicity by 8%; restored 400+ devices improving operational efficiency; delivered 36 lessons to 200+ learners with a 96% graduation rate; reduced application time by 60% and increased weekly applications by 300%). Metric quality is strong (precise numbers/percentages and internship timeframes) so full metric points apply. Minor shortcomings: a few bullets (e.g., designed AWS reference architectures; automated troubleshooting workflows) lack quantified impact and are slightly vague, so a small penalty was applied. Overall the output is action-oriented, metric-rich, and business-focused, meriting a top normalized rating.
CredTail: Strong alignment on many high-priority items: contact info (email, phone, LinkedIn, New York location) and the AWS Solutions Architect Intern entry (Amazon Web Services, Jun 2025–Sep 2025) match the Retrieval Context exactly; IT Instructor Assistant (Feb 2022–Aug 2023), Alfred project metrics and core cloud/ML skills (AWS services including SageMaker, EC2, S3, Lambda; Azure; CI/CD; FastAPI; ETL/Data Modeling) are supported. Discrepancies found and penalties applied per the evaluation rules: 1) Missing employer: the Software Developer Intern role at WOPLLI Technologies (Jun 2024–Sep 2024) appears in the Retrieval Context but is omitted from the Actual Output (deduction −2). 2) Unsupported technology: JavaScript appears in the Actual Output but is not present in the Structured Profile (only Java/.NET are supported via artifacts) (deduction −2). 3) Direct contradiction / suspected fabrication: IT Support Internship device count differs (Actual says “restored 400+ devices” vs Retrieval Context stating refurbishment/tracking of over 800 devices) — treated as a suspected contradiction (deduction −4). Total deductions produce a credibility score of 2. Recommended verification: confirm the missing WOPLLI employment, validate JavaScript skill inclusion, and clarify the IT Support device count/metrics (these items drove the penalization). Note: other minor omissions (e.g., Master’s GPA/honors formatting) were observed but not penalized under the specified rules.",124,2025-12-18 19:21:11.972359,10,2
75,1087,P4,9.722222222222221,10,5,41.72222222222222,"Punctuality: The score is 0.97 because the sole contradiction is a terminology/detail mismatch: the actual output called it a 'custom database' whereas the retrieval context specifically says the instructor assistant created a Google Sheets database to track student engagement and proficiency, a minor but concrete deviation.
Tone: High professionalism: well-formatted resume with clear headings, proper grammar, and concise bullet points. Strong action orientation: uses active verbs and multiple quantified accomplishments (e.g., automated pipeline processing 1M+ records, 5× faster feedback loops; SageMaker tuning: +5% accuracy, −8% toxicity; 96% graduation rate; 60% reduction in application time, 300% increase in weekly applications). Persona alignment: content and tone fit cloud/data/AI roles (AWS services, SageMaker, CI/CD, microservices, security). Scores are consistent (no meaningful gaps across professionalism, action-orientation, and persona fit).
Alignment: Strengths: resume explicitly lists required languages and cloud skills (Python, Java; AWS services EC2/S3/Lambda/RDS/DynamoDB), microservices architecture, CI/CD, and includes multiple concrete metrics (1M+ records processed; 5× faster feedback loops; 5% model accuracy gain; 8% toxicity reduction; 60% time reduction; 300% application increase; 96% graduation rate). These satisfy tool/technology and measurable-outcome checks. Shortcomings: key Oracle/OCI-specific responsibilities are missing (no OCI, datacenter automation, control‑plane/data‑plane or physical asset lifecycle experience), and there is no evidence of principal-level technical leadership (leading peers, authoring design specs/architecture diagrams, production operations at massive scale); most experience is internship-level. Overall alignment is partial: good on tools and metrics, weak on senior responsibilities and OCI/datacenter domain expertise.
Impact: The output contains multiple achievements that clearly combine an action verb, precise metrics, and business outcomes — for example: automated a sentiment-analysis pipeline processing 1M+ records for 5× faster feedback loops; fine-tuned SageMaker models improving accuracy by 5% and reducing toxicity by 8%; reduced application time by 60% and increased weekly applications by 300%; delivered 36 lessons to 200+ learners with a 96% graduation rate. Metric quality is strong (specific counts and percentages). Weaknesses include several vague/passive bullets without metrics or concrete outcomes (e.g., “Designed AWS architectures, enhancing reliability and compliance,” “reducing manual workload significantly,” “ensuring compliance”), which merits a penalty for vague language. Balancing clear, quantified impacts against those vague statements results in a high but not perfect score.

Core technologies largely match (Python, SQL/NoSQL, AWS services like EC2/S3/Lambda/RDS/DynamoDB, Azure App Service/Functions, ETL Glue/SSIS, SageMaker highlights in experience, Generative AI, CI/CD, SIEM/IDS, microservices). Partial match: master’s institution in Retrieval is specified as “School of Professional Studies” and bachelor’s as “NYC College of Technology” while Actual lists City University of New York more generally. Missing/unsupported item: Actual lists Java in Core Skills but Java is not present in the Retrieval Context (deducted as a technology discrepancy). No suspected fabrications or direct contradictions found.

Tone: Professionalism scored 4/5: resume is well-formatted, clear, and grammatically correct with professional headings and contact links, though a few bullets are a bit generic (e.g., “ensuring efficient solutions”) and some impact metrics are missing. Action-Oriented scored 5/5: strong action verbs and multiple quantified achievements (1M+ records, 5x faster feedback loops, 5% accuracy gain, 96% graduation rate, 60% time reduction). Persona Alignment scored 5/5: tone, technical skills (AWS, SageMaker, CI/CD, ML) and project descriptions closely match a cloud/data engineering or solutions architect persona. Largest gap is 1 point between Professionalism and the other categories (no contradiction). Average = (4+5+5)/3 = 4.7, scaled to the 0–10 reporting range and rounded to an integer for the final score.
Alignment: Resume matches several critical JD responsibilities: ML/model fine-tuning and evaluation (SageMaker fine-tuning, accuracy/toxicity metrics), analyzing customer feedback (sentiment-analysis pipeline processing 1M+ records, 5x faster feedback loops), and improving cloud reliability/security (designed secure, scalable AWS architectures; security skills listed). These are critical matches (3/3). Tools: Azure is mentioned (configured Azure environments) and ML tooling is present (SageMaker, Generative AI), but the resume is AWS-heavy and lacks clear Azure ML/DevOps/Microsoft-specific tooling expected for an Azure CXP Applied Scientist (partial match: ~1 strong Azure mention; notable missing Microsoft/Azure tooling). Outcomes: contains multiple concrete, quantifiable impacts (1M+ records, 5x faster, 5% accuracy gain, 8% toxicity reduction, 96% graduation, Alfred 60% time reduction) — strong measurable results. Overall scoring: strong responsibility and outcome alignment, partial tools alignment; penalty applied for lack of Microsoft/Azure-specific tailoring and limited evidence of deep cross-Microsoft customer engagements, resulting in a moderate-high fit.
Impact: Strong presence of action verbs plus measurable results and business outcomes across many bullets (e.g., automated sentiment pipeline processing 1M+ records with 5x faster feedback loops; fine-tuned SageMaker models +5% accuracy / -8% toxicity; Alfred project -60% application time, +300% weekly applications; 96% cohort graduation; 100+ tickets handled). Metric quality is high (precise counts/percentages), which merits additional points. Minor shortcomings: several bullets lack specific metrics or use vague phrasing (e.g., “enhancing cloud reliability,” “ensuring efficient solutions,” “reducing manual workload significantly”), so a small penalty for occasional vagueness was applied.

Action-Oriented 5/5 — strongly action-driven with quantified impacts (processing 1M+ records; 5x faster feedback loops; +5% accuracy; 8% toxicity reduction; 60% time reduction; 300% increase in weekly applications). Persona Alignment 5/5 — excellent fit for solutions architect/data-science roles (AWS, SageMaker, microservices, CI/CD, data pipelines). Largest gap between component scores is 0; average = 5.0 (this average is mapped to the 0–10 score field).
Alignment: The resume does not demonstrate the core Android responsibilities for the Software Engineer, Android role at Capital One. Critical Android skills (Kotlin, Android SDK/Studio, Jetpack/Android UI, mobile app development) are absent; only Java is listed (partial tools match) and Agile/Scrum is present (optional responsibility match). The resume lists many cloud/ML skills (AWS, SageMaker, QuickSight), CI/CD (GitHub Actions) and quantified outcomes (1M+ records, 5x faster pipelines, 60% time reduction, 300% increased applications), which are strong measurable results but not tied to Android/mobile work. Missing must-have mobile tools and no Capital One/title-specific tailoring or Android projects lead to a significant mismatch. Score reflects: 0 critical responsibility matches, 1 tool match (Java), strong measurable outcomes, and penalty for lack of Android focus and tailoring.
Impact: Strong use of action verbs with measurable results and clear business outcomes across multiple bullets (e.g., “Automated sentiment-analysis pipeline processing 1M+ records, achieving 5x faster feedback loops”; “Fine-tuned models… improving accuracy by 5% and reducing toxicity by 8%”; Alfred project’s 60% time reduction and 300% increase in weekly applications; “36 lessons to 200+ learners, maintaining a 96% cohort graduation rate”). Metric quality is high (precise numbers and percentages) so it merits full metric credit. Minor shortcomings: a few lines use vague language or lack metrics (e.g., “enhancing system interoperability and efficiency,” “reducing manual workload significantly,” “excellent service reviews”), meriting a small penalty for vagueness. Overall satisfies the evaluation steps at a top level.

Action-Oriented 5/5 — strong verbs and multiple quantified results (1M+ records, 5× faster pipeline, ~5% accuracy improvement, 8% toxicity reduction, 60% faster application process, 96% cohort graduation). Persona Alignment 5/5 — content directly matches an AWS/solutions-architect/cloud role (Lambda, SageMaker, Glue, RDS, relevant certifications, FastAPI/OpenAI project). Scores are consistent (no notable gaps); average = 5.0.
Alignment: Responsibility match: Resume explicitly covers several JD responsibilities—design/develop/debug modern web apps/services (critical; demonstrated via internships and projects), ensure scalability/reliability (critical; AWS architectures, scalability claims), troubleshooting/debugging (critical; IT support automation), and secure deployments/data governance (optional/critical; mentions security and Oracle integrations). Missing or weak: leadership/mentoring and ownership at a Principal level (critical), and defining/monitoring performance indicators (optional). Count: 4 strong matches, 2 notable gaps. Tools/tech match: Strong exact matches for many must-haves—Python, PHP, Django/Flask/FastAPI, MySQL and MongoDB, JavaScript, AWS and Azure, Git, CI/CD, Docker. Missing or not-mentioned: explicit REST/SOAP experience, OCI, and server-side performance monitoring/logging (must-haves per JD). Experience years: resume shows internships (2022–2025), so does not meet the 6–7+ years requirement. Outcomes/metrics: Resume provides concrete metrics (1M+ records pipeline, 5× faster feedback loops, ~5% accuracy gain, ~8% toxicity reduction, 96% cohort graduation, 60% time reduction on project) — strong measurable impact. Scoring rationale: responsibility alignment (2/3), tools/tech coverage (2/3), measurable outcomes (3/3) = 7; subtract 2 for lack of seniority/Principal-level leadership and missing explicit REST/SOAP/OCI/perf-monitoring → final score mapped to 5/10.
Impact: Multiple bullets clearly include action verbs, measurable results, and business outcomes (e.g., “Automated sentiment-analysis pipeline processing 1M+ records, achieving 5× faster feedback loops,” “Fine-tuned models… improving accuracy by ~5% and reducing toxicity by ~8%,” and “Developed… reducing application time by 60%”), satisfying the Step 1 criteria. Metric quality is strong with precise counts/percentages (1M+, 5×, 5%, 8%, 60%, 96% grad rate, GPAs), so full metric points were awarded per Step 2. A small penalty was applied for some vague wording (phrases like “enhancing security and scalability,” “reducing manual workload significantly,” and “enhancing application deployment efficiency” lack quantified outcomes), per Step 3. After normalization, the output scores at the top of the range for clarity, measurable impact, and business relevance.
CredTail: Strong alignment on high-priority items: name, email, phone, location, LinkedIn/GitHub, employers (Amazon Web Services; WOPLLI Technologies; Mayor’s Office of Information Services; RF CUNY & Generation USA), employment dates (AWS Jun 2025–Sep 2025; WOPLLI Jun 2024–Sep 2024; Mayor’s Office Feb 2024–May 2024; Instructor Feb 2022–Aug 2023), education (M.S. expected Jan 2026 at CUNY SPS; B.Tech Jun 2024 at CUNY City Tech with stated GPAs), certifications (AWS Solutions Architect, AWS AI Practitioner, Google Cybersecurity, Google Information Support), and project “Alfred” — all explicitly supported by the Retrieval Context. Discrepancies (penalized): several core technologies listed in the Actual Output are not present in the Retrieval Context — Languages: Java, PHP, JavaScript; Frameworks: Django, Flask. Using the scoring rubric (start 10; −2 for each unsupported technology), these five unsupported core technologies reduce the score to the floor. No direct contradictions found; many items are exact matches or partial matches (e.g., Actual lists AWS Lambda/Glue/RDS which are supported; project techs and metrics are supported though Retrieval names GPT-4.1 mini specifically). Recommendation: verify the unsupported language/framework claims (Java, PHP, JavaScript, Django, Flask) with source documents or the candidate before relying on them.",166,2025-12-18 19:32:33.198286,10,0

Tone: High professionalism: well-structured resume with clear headings, correct grammar, concise summary, and polished contact/education sections. Strongly action-oriented: uses forceful verbs and multiple quantified outcomes (e.g., automated pipeline processing 1M+ records for 5× faster feedback, SageMaker fine-tuning +5% accuracy/-8% toxicity, Alfred project −60% application time/+300% applications, 96% cohort grad rate). Excellent persona alignment: content and tools (AWS, SageMaker, Python, ETL, certifications) match a cloud/data/ML solutions architect persona. No significant shortcomings noted.
Alignment: Strong alignment with typical Data Analyst expectations: the resume explicitly shows critical responsibilities such as ETL/ELT and automated data pipelines, data modeling, and data visualization (Power BI, QuickSight), and programming (Python, SQL, R). Tools/technologies match well: AWS (EC2, S3, Lambda, SageMaker), Azure, Python, SQL, Power BI, Git, Docker — several key matches present; missing commonly expected items like Tableau or an explicit Excel mention (JD did not list specific must-haves). Outcomes are well quantified across experience and projects (1M+ records processed, 5× faster pipelines, 5% model accuracy gain/8% toxicity reduction, 96% cohort graduation, 60% time reduction/300% application increase), which strongly supports impact. Shortcomings: the job posting provided no granular responsibilities, so matching required some role-based inference; the resume contains some generic summary language and is not explicitly tailored to Hemma Systems Inc or the paid placement/training program (no mention of OPT/STEM/placement-related experience). Based on responsibility match, tool coverage, and strong measurable outcomes (with a modest penalty for generic wording and lack of company/program tailoring), this response merits a score reflecting good but not perfect alignment.
Impact: Many resume bullets contain the three required elements: action verb + measurable result + business outcome (examples: automated sentiment pipeline processing 1M+ records with 5× faster feedback loops; fine-tuned SageMaker models with +5% accuracy and −8% toxicity; delivered 36 lessons to 200+ learners with a 96% graduation rate; reduced application time 60% and boosted weekly applications 300%). Metric quality is high (precise counts and percentages throughout). Minor shortcomings: a few lines use vague phrasing (e.g., “significantly,” “enhancing data flow efficiency,” “ensuring scalable deployment”), so a small clarity penalty was applied.
CredTail: Start at 10. Exact matches: degrees (MSc — City University of New York SPS, expected Jan 2026, GPA 4.0, Dean’s List 2x; B.Tech — CUNY NYC College of Technology, Jun 2024, GPA 3.78, honors) are explicitly present in the Retrieval Context; employers and dates match exactly for Solutions Architect Intern (Amazon Web Services, Jun 2025–Sep 2025), Software Developer Intern (WOPLLI, Jun 2024–Sep 2024), IT Support Intern (Mayor’s Office of Information Services, Feb 2024–May 2024), and IT Instructor Assistant (RF CUNY & Generation USA, Feb 2022–Aug 2023). Core technologies clearly supported by the retrieval record include Python, R, SQL, AWS (EC2, S3, Lambda, SageMaker, Bedrock, Glue, QuickSight, etc.), Azure (App Service/Functions/Storage), ETL/ELT & Data Modeling, QuickSight/Power BI, Docker, Git, CI/CD, Generative AI and the Alfred project details (60% reduction in time, GPT integration) and certifications all match. Discrepancies: one listed core technology in the Actual Output (Java) is not present in the Retrieval Context (deduct −2). Additional contradiction (not deducted under the rules but flagged for verification): phone number differs (Actual: 929-305-7353 vs Retrieval: 347-491-2955). No suspected fabrications or missing degrees/employers/dates found. Final score reflects a single high-priority core-technology discrepancy; recommend verifying the Java skill entry and the phone number with source documents.",171,2025-12-18 19:35:21.363868,10,8

Tone: Professionalism 5: well-formatted, formal tone, clear headings and correct grammar throughout. Action-Oriented 5: uses strong verbs and many quantified achievements (e.g., “1M+ records,” “5x faster feedback loops,” “5% accuracy improvement,” “8% toxicity reduction,” “96% graduation rate,” “60% reduced application time,” “300% increase in completed applications”). Persona Alignment 5: content and emphasis strongly match a cloud/data solutions architect persona (AWS internship, SageMaker, cloud services, relevant certifications). Scores are consistent (all 5s), average 5.0, scaled to a 0–10 score of 10.
Alignment: Responsibility match: Resume explicitly shows cloud architecture experience (designed secure, scalable AWS architectures) — marked critical and counted as a match; automation/CI‑CD and security are present (optional matches). Microservices leadership and domain (financial services) are not shown. Tools/technologies: Exact Azure items present are limited to App Service and Functions (1 match); strong AWS tooling is listed but key Azure must-haves for this role (AKS/Kubernetes, Terraform/ARM, Azure DevOps) are missing. Outcomes/metrics: Resume provides concrete, quantifiable results (1M+ records pipeline, 5x faster feedback, 5% model accuracy gain, 8% toxicity reduction, 96% cohort graduation), which is strong. Penalty: candidate is largely intern-level with no explicit microservices or financial-services leadership and the summary is somewhat generic, so I subtract points for lack of senior/role-specific tailoring. Combining responsibility (2/3), tools (1/3), outcomes (3/3) and a deduction for generic/lack of seniority yields the final score.
Impact: Multiple bullets include an action verb + measurable result + clear business outcome (e.g., “Built automated sentiment analysis pipeline processing 1M+ records, achieving 5x faster feedback loops”; “Fine-tuned models… improving accuracy by 5% and reducing toxicity by 8%”; “Delivered 36 lessons to 200+ learners, achieving a 96% graduation rate”; “Alfred… reducing application time by 60% and increasing completed applications by 300% weekly”). Metrics are specific (counts, percentages, multipliers). Minor vague phrasing appears in some lines (“ensuring compliance,” “reducing manual workload significantly”), so a small clarity penalty was applied.
CredTail: Most high-priority items in the Actual Output are directly supported by the Retrieval Context: degrees (M.S. Data Science & ML, expected Jan 2026; B.Tech Computer Information Systems, Jun 2024) match, all listed employers and their employment dates match exactly (AWS Jun 2025–Sep 2025; WOPLLI Jun 2024–Sep 2024; Mayor’s Office Feb 2024–May 2024; IT Instructor Feb 2022–Aug 2023), and core technologies called out in the Actual Output (AWS services including EC2/S3/Lambda/RDS/Glue/QuickSight/Bedrock/SageMaker, Azure App Service/Functions, Python, SQL/NoSQL, ETL/ELT, FastAPI, Docker, CI/CD, SIEM, Active Directory, Linux, etc.) are present in the Retrieval Context. Exact matches/evidence: education entries, employer names, dates, project (Alfred) tech and impact, and listed AWS/Azure/ML tooling. Discrepancies: (1) Honors inconsistency — Bachelor’s Dean’s List count differs (Actual: 8x; Retrieval: 5x) and Retrieval notes Master’s Dean’s List 2x which the Actual omits (flagged as contradictory/missing honors); (2) contact phone differs (Actual: 929-305-7353 vs Retrieval: 347-491-2955) — a direct contradiction but lower priority. I applied a small penalty for the honors contradiction(s) while treating the phone mismatch as a minor verification issue.

Tone: Professionalism: 5 — clean, well-formatted resume with professional tone, correct grammar, and clear sections (header, summary, skills, experience, projects, education). Action-Oriented: 5 — uses strong verbs and quantifies impact (e.g., “1M+ records,” “5× faster feedback loops,” “improving accuracy by 5%,” “reducing application time by 60%”). Persona Alignment: 5 — content, skills (AWS, SageMaker, Glue, Azure, CI/CD), projects, and certifications align strongly with a cloud/data solutions architect role. Scores are consistent (no gaps); average of the three subscores is 5.0, yielding the top-scale rating.
Alignment: Responsibilities: The resume explicitly shows Azure experience (App Service, Functions, Storage) — marked critical and counted as a match; cloud architecture experience is present (Solutions Architect Intern at AWS) — counted as a match but in an AWS context (critical); microservices leadership or design is not explicitly stated (critical) and is a non-match; financial-services domain experience is not present (critical) and is a non-match. Tools/technologies: Azure components are listed (exact match for basic Azure services), but key platform items commonly required for cloud/microservices roles (e.g., AKS/Kubernetes, service mesh) are missing and the profile is AWS-heavy (partial mismatch). Outcomes/metrics: strong — several concrete metrics (1M+ records pipeline, 5× faster feedback, SageMaker +5% accuracy and −8% toxicity, Alfred reduced application time by 60%, 96% graduation rate), which earn full credit for measurable impact. Scoring rationale applied: responsibility matches limited (1 of 3 critical), tools match partial, measurable outcomes excellent; deducted points for lack of microservices/financial-services tailoring and some generic summary language.
Impact: Multiple bullets include action verbs plus measurable results and clear business outcomes (e.g., “Automated sentiment analysis pipeline processing 1M+ records, achieving 5× faster feedback loops,” “Fine-tuned models… improving accuracy by 5% and reducing toxicity by 8%,” Alfred reducing application time by 60%, and 36 lessons to 200+ learners with a 96% graduation rate), satisfying the action+metric+outcome requirement. Metric quality is high with precise numbers/percentages. Minor weaknesses are some vague phrases (e.g., “enhancing client satisfaction,” “reducing manual workload significantly,” “ensuring compliance and performance”) that slightly reduce clarity. Overall, strong alignment with the evaluation criteria, with only small wording vagueness penalized.

Tone: All three evaluation dimensions scored at the top: Professionalism (5) — polished resume formatting, clear headings, correct grammar, and concise summary/contact info; Action-Oriented (5) — frequent strong verbs and quantified outcomes (e.g., 30% query improvement, 50% increased insights, 40% pipeline time reduction, 5× faster processing, 96% graduation rate); Persona Alignment (5) — content directly targets data/healthcare analytics and cloud/AWS roles (SageMaker, QuickSight, AWS certifications). No major shortcomings noted in the provided output, so the averaged result scales to a perfect score.
Alignment: Strengths: Resume explicitly matches critical JD responsibilities for data modeling (listed as 5+ years in healthcare data analytics) and creating/optimizing data structures/ETL (automated pipelines, 40% processing time reduction); also shows collaboration (led cross-functional teams) — count: ~2 strong responsibility matches (critical: data modeling; critical/optional: ETL/optimization). Tools: exact matches for Python and SQL and a visualization tool (QuickSight) are present; Git and explicit UML/Kimball/data‑warehouse/lakehouse design experience are missing — tools match: partial (2 of key 3 must-haves). Outcomes: strong, concrete metrics throughout (30% query performance improvement, 50% dashboard insight increase, 40% pipeline time reduction, 100% on-time delivery) — rewards measurable impact. Shortcomings: lack of clear, documented healthcare-specific roles/experience timeline to support the 5+ years claim, no mention of Git or data modeling frameworks (Kimball/UML), and no Progyny/company-specific tailoring. Applying the rubric (responsibility match ~2/3, tools ~2/3, outcomes ~3/3, minus penalty for lack of tailoring/evidence) yields a final score of 5.
Impact: Strong presence of action verbs with measurable results and clear business outcomes across many bullets (e.g., “optimized data queries, improving performance by 30%”; “developed QuickSight dashboards, increasing stakeholder insights by 50%”; “automated data pipelines, reducing processing time by 40%”; AWS internship: automated sentiment pipeline for 1M+ records, 5× faster feedback; fine-tuned SageMaker models +5% accuracy/−8% toxicity; 36 lessons to 200+ learners with 96% graduation; restored 400+ devices; automated troubleshooting −25% manual work). Metric quality is high (precise %s, counts, and multipliers), so add full credit. Minor shortcomings: a few vague phrases (e.g., “enhancing instructional effectiveness,” “stakeholder insights”) and some metrics lack explicit timeframes. Overall assessment aligns strongly with the evaluation steps, with only small clarity issues.
CredTail: Score reflects close alignment on education, AWS role, IT Instructor role, certifications, and many core technologies (Python, SQL, QuickSight, SageMaker, ETL, data modeling) but several discrepancies penalize credibility.

Partial/unsupported items: Mayor’s Office role present but retrieval lists Feb 2024–May 2024 while Actual lists Feb 2024–Current (date discrepancy — medium priority). Missing from Actual: Software Developer Intern at WOPLLI Technologies (Jun 2024–Sep 2024) — employer omission (high priority). Suspected fabrications/direct contradictions (high penalty): Actual claims “5+ years in healthcare data analytics” (not supported in retrieval) and experience metric mismatch—Actual “restored 400+ devices” vs retrieval “refurbished and tracked over 800 devices.” Applying the instructed penalties (degrees/employers/dates/technologies and suspected fabrications) reduces the initial credibility to the floor.

Tone: The resume demonstrates strong action-orientation and persona alignment: it uses result-focused action verbs (Designed, Built, Automated, Fine-tuned) and cites measurable outcomes (processing 1M+ records, 5× faster feedback loops, ~5% accuracy improvement, ~8% toxicity reduction). It is well-aligned to an AWS/data-science/solutions-architect persona with concrete tooling (Bedrock, SageMaker, Glue, QuickSight, FastAPI, PostgreSQL+pgvector). Shortcomings are mostly in professionalism: minor formatting and consistency issues (inconsistent punctuation/spacing, some header/location formatting) that slightly reduce polish and tonal consistency; this category is at least one point lower than the top categories, indicating a small imbalance.
Alignment: The job is for an Android Software Engineer at Capital One, which requires Android/mobile-specific skills (Kotlin/Java, Android SDK/Studio, UI/Jetpack Compose, mobile testing/CI, experience shipping apps). The resume shows strong cloud/ML/backend experience (AWS, SageMaker, Bedrock, FastAPI, Postman, Git, Agile) and clear measurable outcomes (1M+ record pipeline, 5× faster dashboards, model accuracy/toxicity improvements), so REST API integration, version control, and Agile are explicitly present and teamwork is implied. However Android toolset and mobile app experience are entirely absent, so most core requirements are missing. Applied penalty for ignoring the Android role; granted a small bonus for measurable results. Overall alignment is low.
Impact: Multiple explicit action verbs and several measurable outcomes are present (automated sentiment pipeline processing 1M+ records; 5× faster feedback loops; ~5% accuracy improvement; ~8% toxicity reduction; 36 lessons for 200+ learners; GPA/certifications). Ownership language is active (Designed, Built, Automated, Fine-tuned) and ties to clear business impact. Minor shortcomings: no dollar amounts and a few high‑level summary phrases, but overall the output contains strong, quantifiable accomplishments and explicit attribution.

Education degrees and dates (MSc Data Science & ML expected Jan 2026; BTech Jun 2024) and listed certifications align exactly. Core technologies largely match (Python, SQL/NoSQL, AWS services including Bedrock/SageMaker/Glue/QuickSight, FastAPI, Docker, Postgre + pgvector), but are a partial match because the Retrieval Context explicitly lists items not shown or named slightly differently in the Actual Output (explicit “Generative AI (LLMs, prompt structuring, fine-tuning, guardrails)”, R programming, Power BI, SIEM/IDS, and the Retrieval project lists GPT-4.1 mini vs “GPT-4 Mini” wording). No fabricated items were found. Because all critical fields (degree, employers, dates) are verified and only core-tech naming/details are partial, the score is reduced slightly to reflect that single partial mismatch.",159,2025-12-18 19:21:34.582067,10,9

Tone: Professionalism: resume uses formal, concise language, consistent headings, clean formatting, and correct grammar (clear contact block, summary, competencies, experience). Action-oriented: heavy use of strong verbs and measurable outcomes (e.g., “1M+ records,” “5× faster feedback loops,” accuracy improvement, toxicity reduction, 96% graduation rate) that emphasize impact. Persona alignment: tailored to cloud/data/ML roles with specific AWS services (Bedrock, SageMaker, Glue, Athena), RAG, FastAPI, CI/CD, and relevant tooling, matching the Solutions Architect/Data Scientist persona. Minor improvement: add clearer business context for a couple of projects and ensure consistent tense across bullets.
Alignment: The resume shows relevant AWS technical skills (Glue, Athena, Lambda, SageMaker, Bedrock, QuickSight) and concrete metrics (sentiment pipeline processing 1M+ records, 5× faster feedback loops, ~5% model accuracy gain, ~8% toxicity reduction), which are exact matches for technical tooling and measurable outcomes. However, it omits multiple top-priority items from the job: no mention of Amazon Connect, Contact Center solutions, WFM or CRM experience, AWS WWSO Apps, Partner/Go-to-Market responsibilities, or senior/WW specialist-level role duties. The profile reads early-career/internship-focused and lacks company/title-specific keywords (WW Specialist, Partner Org) and partner-facing achievements, so most high-priority role expectations are missing or only partially implied despite strong technical matches.
Impact: I scored this a mid-level rating because several bullets contain clear actions with measurable outcomes (which raised the score) but many others are vague or lack metrics (which lowered it). Strengths: the AWS role includes strong, measurable impact (automated sentiment pipeline processing 1M+ records with 5× faster feedback loops; SageMaker fine-tuning improved accuracy ~5% and reduced toxicity ~8%), and the instructor role shows concrete outcomes (36 lessons for 200+ learners and a 96% graduation rate). These bullets drove the rating upward. Shortcomings: multiple bullets (WOPLLI role: Virtual Credential System, Azure config, diagrams, Postman scripts; IT support: monitoring, VIP support) describe actions without quantifiable results and use non-specific phrasing; I applied penalties for vague/passive language on those bullets. Overall the normalized average of per-bullet scores yields a middle-range rating reflecting strong measurable wins but inconsistent specificity across the resume.

Tone: Professionalism 5/5: clear, formal layout with correct grammar and consistent tone; minor nit like “Postgre” label and slight punctuation inconsistency. Action-Oriented 4/5: strong action verbs and some measurable outcomes (e.g., “Automated a sentiment-analysis pipeline processing 1M+ records,” “improving accuracy and reducing toxicity”), but several bullets lack quantified impact or clear results. Persona Alignment 5/5: terminology, tools (AWS, SageMaker, Glue, QuickSight), and responsibility scope map closely to a solutions-architect/data/ML persona. Average maps to a high overall score; note imbalance: Action-Oriented is one point below the highest category, suggesting opportunities to add more explicit metrics and outcome-focused language.
Alignment: The resume covers many technical requirements explicitly: Python, REST APIs/FastAPI, AWS (EC2/S3/Lambda/RDS/Glue/QuickSight), Azure, MySQL and MongoDB, Docker, Git, monitoring/logging (Glue/Athena/QuickSight), secure/scalable architecture and troubleshooting. It lacks key senior-role expectations: 6+ years of experience, leadership/mentorship, explicit Django/Flask framework experience, client/server-side JavaScript, OCI, and CI/CD/DevOps automation; collaboration with PM/QA/CloudOps is not shown. Match computes to roughly two-thirds of requirements; the clear measurable outcome (1M+ records pipeline) warranted a +1 boost while the resume’s early-career/lack of senior leadership fit warranted a -1 penalty, producing the final score.
Impact: Strong use of active verbs (Designed, Built, Automated, Fine-tuned) and multiple concrete metrics (automated pipeline processing 1M+ records, taught 200+ learners, GPA 4.0) aligns with Step 1’s criteria for measurable results, so a high base is warranted. However, several impact statements are vague or unquantified (e.g., “improving accuracy and reducing toxicity” with no percent/delta, no time- or dollar-saved figures), which triggers the Step 3 penalty for non‑quantified outcomes. The resume does tie work to business outcomes (actionable sentiment insights, real-time QuickSight dashboards), justifying a small positive adjustment per Step 4. Overall assessment follows the outlined steps: multiple clear metrics and ownership, minor deductions for vague performance claims, resulting in this score.
CredTail: High consistency: degrees (MS Data Science expected Jan 2026 with 4.0; B.Tech Jun 2024, GPA 3.78) are exact matches to the Retrieval Context. Employers and roles (AWS Solutions Architect Intern, WOPLLI Software Developer Intern, Mayor’s Office IT Support Intern, RF CUNY/Generation USA Instructor Assistant) and their dates align exactly. Contact info and certifications also match. Core technologies largely match (Python, AWS services, Azure, Glue, QuickSight, SageMaker referenced in experience), but the Core Skills section in the Actual Output omits some AWS items present in the Retrieval Context (Bedrock, Macie listed in retrieval) and drops the quantitative performance metrics (e.g., 5× faster, ~5% accuracy gain, ~8% toxicity reduction) — so core techs/achievements are a partial match rather than perfect. No fabricated items detected. Because all critical fields are verified with only minor omissions/partial matches, the score is lowered one point from perfect.",164,2025-12-18 19:24:04.893977,8,9

Tone: Professionalism — high: the output is formal, well-structured, and grammatically correct with consistent tone; only a minor nit ('Postgre' looks truncated and should be 'PostgreSQL'). Action-oriented — strong: uses active verbs (Designed, Built, Automated, Fine-tuned) and includes measurable outcomes and metrics from the file (processed 1M+ records; 5× faster feedback loops; ~5% accuracy improvement; ~8% toxicity reduction). Persona alignment — excellent: wording, tools, and accomplishments align tightly with an AWS/ML/solutions-architect persona (Bedrock, Glue, SageMaker, QuickSight, LLMs). Averaging these category assessments yields the top composite score and there are no categories that are significantly lower than the others.
Alignment: The resume fully covers the Data Analyst requirements inferred from the Hemma Systems posting: explicit skills and responsibilities include Python (pandas), SQL/NoSQL, ETL/ELT, data visualization (QuickSight, Power BI), statistical analysis/ML (PyTorch, SageMaker), cloud experience (AWS and Azure), and demonstrated outcomes (sentiment pipeline processing 1M+ records, 5× faster feedback loops, ~5% accuracy gain, ~8% toxicity reduction). All core tools/responsibilities are explicitly present, there is no evident boilerplate, and measurable impacts are provided (bonus), yielding a top-aligned result.
Impact: The resume contains multiple clear action verbs (e.g., Designed, Built, Automated, Fine‑tuned) and several concrete metrics and outcomes: automated pipeline processing 1M+ records, 5× faster feedback loops, ~5% accuracy improvement and ~8% toxicity reduction, 36 lessons for 200+ learners, and strong educational metrics. Language is largely active and ownership is explicit; only minor high‑level phrasing (e.g., “accelerates application throughput”) is slightly vague but does not undermine measurable results. These strengths justify a top score under the evaluation rubric.
CredTail: High fidelity to the Retrieval Context: personal info (name, email, phone, links, location) and summary match exactly; education entries (MS expected Jan 2026, BS Jun 2024, GPAs, honors) match exactly; AWS Solutions Architect internship (Amazon Web Services, Arlington, Jun 2025–Sep 2025) and its highlights match exactly; WOPLLI (Jun 2024–Sep 2024), Mayor’s Office (Feb 2024–May 2024), and IT Instructor Assistant (Feb 2022–Aug 2023) entries and dates are present but several retrieval highlights were omitted (e.g., WOPLLI’s Virtual Credential work and vendor management; Mayor’s Office device refurbishment, CrowdStrike monitoring; instructor 96% graduation stat). Core technologies largely match (AWS services, SageMaker, Bedrock, databases, Python libs, Postman) but several core skills from the Retrieval Context are missing from the Actual Output (explicit Azure core-skill line, Docker, R, some security/CI-CD items). No fabricated facts detected. Score reduced for omissions of project (Alfred is absent) and several missing core-skill details and experience highlights, resulting in a near-complete but not perfect alignment.",169,2025-12-18 19:26:17.736449,10,8

Tone: All three evaluated areas are strong and balanced. Professionalism: high formality, clear grammar, consistent sections and tone (clean headings, bullet points). Action-oriented: uses strong verbs and measurable outcomes (processed over 1M records, 5× faster feedback-to-action, 5% accuracy gain, 8% reduction in toxicity, 96% cohort graduation). Persona alignment: content and vocabulary closely match Solutions Architect/Data Science/Generative AI roles (AWS services like Bedrock, SageMaker, QuickSight; RAG, FastAPI). No category is ≥1 point lower than the highest; only minor formatting/punctuation nitpicks in the contact line that don’t affect overall quality.
Alignment: Extracted requirements (7): Azure expertise, cloud architecture, microservices, lead/cloud solutions, financial-services domain, scalable/secure outcomes, hyper-growth leadership. Resume shows 3 explicit matches (Azure tools, cloud architecture, measurable outcomes), 2 implied (microservices/lead experience), and 2 absent (financial-services, hyper-growth leadership) → ~57% match (50–74% band). Penalized for AWS-heavy focus vs an Azure role but credited for measurable impact and explicit Azure tooling, yielding a mid-level alignment.
Impact: High score because the resume contains multiple clear action verbs and measurable results: built a pipeline processing over 1M feedback records, enabled a 5× faster feedback-to-action turnaround via QuickSight dashboards, achieved a 5% accuracy gain and 8% reduction in toxicity from fine‑tuning, and drove a 96% cohort graduation rate (36 lessons for 200+ learners). Ownership language is explicit (Built, Designed, Fine‑tuned). Small deductions for a few unquantified bullets (e.g., Azure environment configuration, API testing scripts) and lack of dollar amounts or exact time savings in some items, but overall strong, business‑oriented metrics and clear attribution.
CredTail: Degrees (M.S. Data Science & Machine Learning expected Jan 2026; B.Tech CIS June 2024) with GPAs match the Retrieval Context. Employers and dates for all internships (AWS Jun–Sep 2025, WOPLLI Jun–Sep 2024, Mayor’s Office Feb–May 2024, RF CUNY Feb 2022–Aug 2023) and project/technology claims (AWS services: Bedrock, SageMaker, Glue, Lambda, Athena, QuickSight; Alfred using FastAPI, PostgreSQL+pgvector, GPT-4.1 mini, Docker, CI/CD) are all verified against the Retrieval Context. Certifications largely match (AWS Solutions Architect – Associate; AWS Certified AI Practitioner – Generative AI; Google Cybersecurity Certificate), but the Retrieval Context also lists a Google Information Support Certificate that is omitted in the Actual Output (missing). The Dean’s List honor count differs (Retrieval: 5x vs Actual: 8x) — partial mismatch. No fabricated employers, dates, or core techs found. These are minor inconsistencies, so the score reflects high overall consistency with small omissions/one partial mismatch.",174,2025-12-18 19:28:49.839144,9,9

Tone: Professionalism is strong (clear structure, consistent tone), but has minor issues such as an all-caps header and a grammatical slip (“a 8% reduction”), causing a one-point deficit versus other categories. Action-oriented is excellent: frequent strong verbs and measurable outcomes (processing over 1M records, 5× faster feedback-to-action, 5% accuracy gain, 96% cohort graduation) demonstrate results focus. Persona alignment is highly appropriate for cloud/AI roles—explicit AWS/Bedrock/SageMaker, RAG, CI/CD, and relevant tooling match the target solutions architect/ML persona. Overall the resume is well-crafted but slightly imbalanced by the noted professionalism nitpicks.
Alignment: Extracted requirements: Azure expertise, lead cloud solutions & microservices, Cloud Solutions Architect experience, financial-services domain, measurable outcomes (scalability/impact), CI/CD/deployment tooling. Resume strengths: explicit Azure skills (App Service, Functions, Storage), Solutions Architect Intern (AWS) experience, CI/CD/Docker, and clear measurable outcomes (1M records processed, 5× faster turnaround, model accuracy/toxicity improvements). Shortcomings: no senior/lead role, financial-services experience absent, microservices only implied and heavy AWS emphasis (title/provider mismatch). Match = (4 explicit + 0.5*1 implied)/7 = ~64% → base score ~6; +1 bonus for measurable outcomes/tool usage, −1 penalty for provider/title mismatch → final score 6.
Impact: High marks for multiple explicit action verbs and concrete metrics: built/deployed a pipeline processing over 1M records with a 5× faster feedback-to-action turnaround, fine-tuned models yielding a 5% accuracy gain and 8% reduction in toxicity/hallucinations, and a 96% cohort graduation rate from instructional work. Active ownership is clear (e.g., “Built,” “Fine-tuned,” “Designed”), and results tie directly to business/user impact. Minor non‑quantified bullets (e.g., Azure configuration, some architecture notes) are present but do not outweigh the strong measurable accomplishments, so the highest score is warranted.
CredTail: Degrees, employers, dates, and core technologies largely match the Retrieval Context: Master of Science (Data Science & ML) Expected Jan 2026 with GPA 4.0 (exact), Bachelor of Technology (CUNY NYCCT) Jun 2024 with GPA 3.78 (exact), AWS Solutions Architect Intern (Jun 2025–Sep 2025), WOPLLI (Jun 2024–Sep 2024), Mayor’s Office (Feb 2024–May 2024), and RF CUNY instructor role (Feb 2022–Aug 2023) all match. Core techs (AWS services including Bedrock, SageMaker, Glue, QuickSight; Azure App Service/Functions/Storage; Python, SQL, PostgreSQL+pgvector, FastAPI, GPT‑4.1 mini, RAG) are consistent with the retrieval data. Shortcomings: an honors detail (Dean’s List listed as 8× in the Actual Output vs 5× in the Retrieval Context) is a partial/fabricated discrepancy, and one certification from the Retrieval Context (Google Information Support Certificate) is omitted. Because all critical fields (degree, employer, dates, core tech) are verified and only minor/one-off mismatches exist, the response receives a high credibility score with a small penalty for the fabricated/omitted items.",179,2025-12-18 19:31:04.927535,10,9

Tone: High professionalism: clear, well-formatted resume with proper grammar and consistent tone (e.g., Summary, Core Skills, Education). Strong action orientation: uses active verbs (Designed, Built, Automated, Fine-tuned, Delivered) and includes measurable outcomes (1M+ records processed, ~5% accuracy improvement, ~8% toxicity reduction, 96% graduation rate). Strong persona alignment for an AWS/data-science/solutions architect role: relevant AWS stack (Bedrock, Athena, Glue, SageMaker), certifications, and ML/data pipeline experience. No category is ≥1 point lower than the highest score, so no imbalance flagged.
Alignment: Resume has strong explicit technical skills (Python, SQL, Git), AWS/ETL and visualization experience with measurable outcomes (1M+ records processed, QuickSight dashboards, model accuracy/toxicity improvements) but lacks the job’s core requirements—notably 5+ years in healthcare analytics and 5+ years data modeling, senior stakeholder/data-governance responsibilities (UML/Kimball, data standards, query optimization), and mostly reflects intern/early-career roles, so it only partially matches the Senior Data Analyst requirements.
Impact: Strong presence of explicit action verbs and multiple measurable results (automated pipeline processing 1M+ records; ~5% accuracy improvement; ~8% toxicity reduction; delivered 36 lessons to 200+ learners with a 96% graduation rate; GPAs/certifications). Ownership is clear (designed/presented/built/automated/fine-tuned) and business impact is tied to real‑time dashboards and actionable insights. Minimal passive/vague language, so no significant penalties.
CredTail: Degrees (M.S. expected Jan 2026; B.Tech Jun 2024) exactly match the Retrieval Context. Key employers and roles (AWS Solutions Architect Intern, Mayor’s Office IT Support Intern, RF CUNY/Generation USA Instructor Assistant) and their dates match exactly. Core technologies largely match (Python, SQL/NoSQL, major AWS services, Glue, QuickSight, SageMaker referenced), but the Actual Output omits several technologies and project tools present in the Retrieval Context (Azure, FastAPI/Docker/PostgreSQL+pgvector/OpenAI details) — so core tech is a partial match. One employer from the Retrieval Context (WOPLLI Technologies, Jun–Sep 2024) is missing from the Actual Output. There is a phone-number inconsistency within the Retrieval Context (structured phone 347-491-2955 vs. artifact 929-305-7353) and the Actual Output uses the latter; this is a minor discrepancy but not a clear fabrication. No clear fabricated items were detected. Given all major degrees and most employers/dates are verified but with one missing employer and partial core-tech coverage, the score is reduced from perfect to reflect these gaps.",184,2025-12-18 19:34:18.760512,10,8

No category is ≥1 point lower than the highest, indicating balance across criteria.
Alignment: Resume shows strong technical alignment (explicit Python, AWS/SageMaker, distributed data pipelines and measurable outcomes like 1M+ records, 5× faster feedback loops, ~5% accuracy gain) — I counted ~6 explicit and 10 implied matches out of 27 core requirements (~41% match). However it lacks management evidence required by Meta (no team leadership/recruiting/performance management, no completed Master + 3+ years, limited roadmap/org-level ownership), so penalties for missing manager-specific responsibilities outweigh a small bonus for clear metrics and explicit tools.
Impact: Strong use of action verbs and multiple concrete metrics: automated a sentiment pipeline processing 1M+ records, delivered 5× faster feedback loops, fine‑tuned models (+~5% accuracy, −8% toxicity), taught 36 lessons to 200+ learners with a 96% graduation rate. These demonstrate clear ownership and measurable outcomes tied to business/operational impact. Minor shortcomings: a few bullets (e.g., “designed and presented AWS reference architectures,” “configured Azure environments”) lack explicit quantitative business impact, so a small deduction for limited quantification on some items.

Action-oriented language is strong—uses verbs like Designed, Built, Automated, Fine-tuned—and includes measurable outcomes (processed 1M+ records, 5× faster feedback loops, ~5% accuracy gain, 8% toxicity reduction, 96% cohort graduation rate). Persona alignment is excellent for solutions-architect/data-science roles, citing relevant AWS services (Bedrock, SageMaker, Athena/Glue/Lambda), QuickSight dashboards, and generative AI tooling. No major imbalances across professionalism, results focus, or role alignment.
Alignment: The resume misses core Android/Lead requirements: Android development, Kotlin/Java, Android SDK/Studio, mobile performance/testing, and production Android releases are absent, while leadership as a Lead is only implied (instructor/architect roles). It does include explicit matches for cloud/backend (AWS/Azure), APIs, CI/CD, Git, Agile, and measurable outcomes (1M+ record pipeline, 5× faster feedback, ~5% accuracy gain, 96% cohort rate). I counted 11 total requirements: 5 explicit + 1 implied = 50% match, mapping to a mid-range score; I subtracted a point for ignoring the Lead Android specifics and added a point for clear metrics and relevant tools, yielding the final score.
Impact: Multiple explicit action verbs (Designed, Built, Automated, Fine-tuned) and several concrete metrics (processed 1M+ records; 5× faster feedback loops; ~5% accuracy gain; ~8% toxicity reduction; 96% cohort graduation rate; 36 lessons for 200+ learners) justify a high base rating per step 1. Compared to typical outputs, this one shows strong measurable accomplishments and clear ownership. Minor shortcomings: some entries lack quantification (e.g., the Virtual Credential System, Azure configuration) and a few generic skill lines introduce slight vagueness. Clear ties to business outcomes (real-time dashboards, actionable sentiment insights) support a positive final adjustment.

No category is one or more points below the highest, showing balanced strengths across evaluation criteria.
Alignment: Extracted requirements: design/implement/manage cloud solutions; stakeholder collaboration; develop/deploy scalable, secure, efficient architectures; integrate Azure services with existing systems; lead on‑premises→cloud migrations. Resume evidence: explicit design/implementation of secure, scalable AWS architectures and deployed pipelines (present); measurable outcomes (1M records processed, 5% accuracy gain, 8% toxicity reduction) and security work (present); management, stakeholder collaboration, efficiency, and Azure integration are implied; on‑premises migration experience is absent. Match = (4 explicit + 0.5*4 implied)/9 ≈ 66.7%, mapping to midrange (score 6). Applied +1 bonus for clear measurable outcomes/explicit Azure configuration and −1 penalty for ignoring the job’s Azure/migration emphasis and some role mismatch, yielding a final score of 6.
Impact: Assigned a high score because the resume contains multiple explicit action verbs and measurable results: built a sentiment pipeline processing over 1M records, achieved a 5% accuracy improvement and 8% toxicity reduction, delivered 36 lessons to 200+ learners with a 96% graduation rate. Language shows clear ownership (designed, built, fine-tuned) and ties to business impact (real-time QuickSight dashboards, faster feedback-to-action).

Tone: Professionalism: strong formatting, clear sections, correct grammar and formal tone; minor issues (e.g., “Postgre” typo, occasional inconsistent product naming). Action‑Oriented: very strong — frequent action verbs (Designed, Built, Automated, Fine‑tuned) and multiple quantified outcomes (1M+ records, 5× faster feedback loops, ~5% accuracy improvement, ~8% toxicity reduction, 60% time reduction, 300% application increase, 800 devices, 96% graduation rate). Persona Alignment: excellent match to cloud/ML/solutions architect roles — extensive AWS/SageMaker/Bedrock, LLMs, CI/CD, data engineering and security skills, and relevant projects/internships. Relative weakness is minor copy/terminology polish and slightly limited senior‑leadership framing. Overall score reflects high alignment with strong action orientation and role fit.
Alignment: Responsibilities: Partial match — resume shows general software development, Agile, and problem-solving but contains no Android/mobile app development, Kotlin/Java, or mobile-specific responsibilities. Tools: Missing — no Android SDK, Jetpack, Kotlin/Java, Android Studio references; resume focuses on AWS (Bedrock, SageMaker, Glue), FastAPI, Docker, GitHub Actions. Outcomes: Partial — resume includes concrete metrics (e.g., 5× faster pipelines, ~5% model accuracy gain, 60% time reduction, 300% application boost) but none tied to Android/mobile product metrics. Applied a moderate 10% penalty for absence of title/company-specific Android language. Weighted match ≈25%, which maps to the provided score range.
Impact: High use of action-oriented language (many strong verbs: Designed, Built, Automated, Fine-tuned, Implemented, Reduced) showing clear ownership (Step 1). Multiple precise metrics are provided (Step 2) such as processing 1M+ records, 5× faster feedback loops, ~5% accuracy improvement and ~8% toxicity reduction, 60% reduced time-to-apply and 300% increase in weekly applications, 96% cohort graduation, >800 devices refurbished, 100+ support tickets — supporting a high measurable-results score. Metrics are tied to business/operational outcomes (Step 3): faster feedback/throughput, improved model quality, increased application volume, operational efficiency and training success, though few items lack explicit baselines or monetary/ROI context. Voice is predominantly active (Step 4), so no penalty for passivity. Overall strong alignment with the evaluation steps, with only minor shortcomings around explicit baselines and financial impact.

Action-Oriented: strong use of action verbs and multiple quantified results (e.g., “1M+ records”, “5× faster feedback loops”, “60% time reduction”, “300% boost”, “96% cohort graduation rate”, “800 devices”), showing results focus. Persona Alignment: terminology, tools, and emphasis (AWS services, Bedrock, SageMaker, ETL, microservices, FastAPI) align tightly with a Solutions Architect/Data/AI role. Minor nitpick: small item naming inconsistency (e.g., “Postgre” likely meant PostgreSQL) but it does not materially reduce clarity. Overall, strengths in formatting, measurable outcomes, and role-specific language justify a top score on the evaluation criteria.
Alignment: The resume shows strong tool and outcome alignment (Exact matches: Python, AWS, Azure, MySQL/MongoDB, REST/APIs, Docker, Git, CI/CD; measurable results like a 1M+ record pipeline, 5× faster feedback loops, +5% model accuracy and 8% toxicity reduction), giving solid outcomes coverage. Responsibilities are only partially met: concrete development, debugging, monitoring and security work are present, but senior-level leadership/architecture and the requested 6–7+ years of experience are missing or underrepresented, and SOAP/Django/Flask and OCI are not shown. The weighting (responsibilities 40%, tools 30%, outcomes 30%) yields a good overall match with no strong generic-content penalty because the resume includes company-specific roles and metrics, but the lack of seniority and some framework/Cloud gaps reduce the fit.
Impact: Strong active ownership across bullets (e.g., “Designed,” “Built,” “Automated,” “Fine‑tuned,” “Implemented”) and clear task ownership in internships and projects. Multiple precise metrics are provided (1M+ records processed; 5× faster feedback loops; ~5% accuracy improvement; ~8% toxicity reduction; 60% reduced time to apply; 300% increase in weekly applications; 96% cohort graduation; 800+ devices; 100+ tickets), tying to operational efficiency, model quality, and user outcomes.

Responsibilities partially match (microservices and architecture listed but experience is intern-level rather than a lead role) and the resume lacks financial-services domain experience. Applied a moderate generic/seniority penalty (10%) to the weighted match (responsibilities 40% partial, tools 30% exact, outcomes 30% exact), mapping the final 70% to the score below.
Impact: Strong active ownership is evident through multiple action verbs (Designed, Built, Automated, Fine-tuned, Implemented, Reduced, Boosted). The output contains several clear, measurable metrics (1M+ records processed; 5× faster feedback loops; ~5% accuracy gain; ~8% toxicity reduction; 96% cohort graduation; 60% time reduction and 300% increase in weekly applications) though baselines/timeframe context for some improvements is missing. Business impact is implied and quantified in operational efficiency and product quality metrics (faster feedback, accuracy/toxicity improvements, increased application throughput), but direct revenue/cost/retention linkage is not stated. Wording is predominantly active with little passive voice, so no penalty for vagueness or passivity.
CredTail: All claims in the Actual Output are present in the Retrieval Context and thus Verified. Verified items: Degrees — Master of Science (CUNY SPS, Expected Jan 2026) and Bachelor of Technology (CUNY NYC College of Technology, Jun 2024) verified; Employers & dates — Solutions Architect Intern at AWS (Jun 2025–Sep 2025), Software Developer Intern at WOPLLI (Jun 2024–Sep 2024), IT Support Intern at Mayor’s Office of Information Services (Feb 2024–May 2024), IT Instructor Assistant at RF CUNY & Generation USA (Feb 2022–Aug 2023) all verified; Core technologies — the full core_skills list (31 items including Python/pandas/scikit-learn/PyTorch, SQL/NoSQL, AWS services including Bedrock/SageMaker/Glue/QuickSight, Azure services, FastAPI/Postman, Docker, Git, Postgre/Oracle/MySQL/MongoDB/DynamoDB, ML algorithms, etc.) verified. Counts: 41 claimed items (2 degrees + 4 employers + 4 employment dates + 31 core technologies) with 41 verified → 100% verified → initial credibility mapped to top scale (10).

Tone: Professionalism: well-formatted resume with clear headings, consistent bullets, and no obvious grammar issues, matching a formal tone. Action-Oriented: heavy use of strong verbs (Designed, Built, Automated, Fine-tuned) and multiple quantified achievements (1M+ records processed, 5× faster feedback loops, ~5% accuracy gain, ~8% toxicity reduction, 96% cohort graduation, 60% time reduction/300% applications increase). Persona Alignment: terminology and emphasis strongly match an AWS/solutions-architect/data-science role (Bedrock, SageMaker, Glue, QuickSight, LLMs, ETL/ELT), and projects/internships align with the target seniority. Minor nit: none substantial in formatting or tone. Based on the three evaluation dimensions, the output demonstrates top alignment.
Alignment: Weighted match: responsibilities=Partial (microservices/architecture present but mostly AWS and intern-level; leadership/senior architect responsibilities missing), tools=Partial (Azure App Service/Functions/Storage listed but resume is AWS-heavy), outcomes=Exact (measurable results: 1M+ record pipeline, 5× faster feedback loops, model improvements, 60% time reduction/300% application increase). Applied moderate 10% penalty for missing financial-services domain experience and limited senior/company-specific leadership. Final mapped score corresponds to ~55% match.
Impact: High use of action-oriented verbs (Designed, Built, Automated, Fine-tuned, Implemented, Developed) demonstrates strong ownership per Step 1. The resume contains multiple clear metrics (1M+ records processed; 5× faster feedback loops; ~5% accuracy improvement; ~8% toxicity reduction; 36 lessons for 200+ learners; 96% graduation rate; 60% reduced time to apply and 300% increase in weekly applications), satisfying Step 2 with precise, measurable results (though some lack explicit baselines). Business impact is generally tied to operational and product outcomes (faster feedback loops, improved model accuracy/toxicity, higher application throughput, high graduation rate) but not consistently quantified in revenue/cost terms, so impact is implied more than financially explicit per Step 3. Wording is active with no pervasive passive voice, so no penalty under Step 4.

Tone: Professionalism: strong—clear headings, consistent formatting and professional tone with minor punctuation inconsistencies and a small typo (“Postgre”). Action-Oriented: strong use of action verbs and numerous quantified results (e.g., 1M+ records, 5× faster feedback loops, ~5% accuracy gain, ~8% toxicity reduction, 800 devices, 96% graduation rate). Persona Alignment: well-matched to an AWS/ML/solutions-architect role with relevant services (Bedrock, SageMaker, Athena/Glue/Lambda) and generative-AI emphasis, though experience level signals internship/junior seniority. Averaging the three 1–5 subscores yields the returned score.
Alignment: Final match ~26% → score 3: resume aligns on hands-on technical requirements and tooling (Python, AWS services, SQL/NoSQL, Docker/Git, participation in technical design) and provides measurable project outcomes (1M+ records processed, 5× faster feedback loops, ~+5% model accuracy, 96% cohort graduation), but misses core managerial responsibilities required by Meta (no evidence of recruiting/managing technical teams, org design/prioritization, staffing/cost ownership, large-scale distributed system architecture or C++/Java/JS expertise); a moderate generic-content penalty (-10%) was applied for lack of company/title-specific management achievements.
Impact: Strong active ownership with many action verbs (Designed, Built, Automated, Fine-tuned, Implemented, Managed). Contains multiple clear metrics (processed 1M+ records, 5× faster feedback loops, ~5% accuracy gain, ~8% toxicity reduction, 800+ devices refurbished, 96% cohort graduation) which show measurable results. Business impact is implied (efficiency, model quality, operational scale) but not consistently tied to explicit business outcomes like revenue/cost savings or baseline comparisons for all metrics. Minimal passive phrasing. Overall a high-alignment profile with minor gaps in explicit business linkage and baseline context.

Tone: Professionalism: resume is formal, well-structured, and grammatically clean with clear headings and contact links; minor issues include a typo/misalabeled DB name (“Postgre”) and some inconsistent capitalization. Action-Oriented: very strong — frequent action verbs and multiple quantified outcomes (e.g., 1M+ records, 5× faster feedback loops, ~5% accuracy gain, ~8% toxicity reduction, 60% time savings, 300% increase in applications). Persona Alignment: well-aligned to solutions-architect/data/ML roles with extensive AWS/Bedrock/SageMaker, LLM, ETL, and CI/CD detail, though most experience is internship-level which slightly limits seniority fit. Overall assessment balances these strengths/weaknesses to produce a high score.
Alignment: Assigned a 4 because the resume shows strong measurable outcomes (exact match: sentiment pipeline 5× faster, model +5% accuracy, Alfred project 60% time reduction) and partial tool overlap (CI/CD, Git, Docker, APIs, AWS) but is missing core responsibilities and Android-specific technologies/leadership (no Kotlin/Java, Android Studio, Jetpack, mobile app delivery experience). A moderate penalty (−10%) was applied for lack of title-specific Android/company tailoring, yielding a final mapped score of 4.
Impact: High use of action-oriented language (many strong verbs: Designed, Built, Automated, Fine-tuned, Implemented, Reduced) showing clear ownership. Multiple precise metrics are provided (1M+ records processed; 5× faster feedback loops; ~5% accuracy improvement; ~8% toxicity reduction; 60% reduction in time-to-apply; 300% increase in weekly applications; 96% cohort graduation rate; 800+ devices refurbished; 100+ tickets), tying to clear business outcomes (efficiency, model quality, applicant throughput, operational capacity). Minor shortcoming: a few metrics lack explicit baselines or timeframes and some improvements are approximate, but passive voice is minimal. Overall strong alignment with the evaluation steps.

Tone: Professionalism: 5/5 — clean, consistent formatting and grammar with clear sections (certifications, education, experience). Action-Oriented: 5/5 — uses strong verbs and measurable outcomes (processed over 1M feedback records, 5× faster feedback-to-action, 5% accuracy gain, 8% reduction in toxicity, 96% cohort graduation rate). Persona Alignment: 5/5 — content maps tightly to cloud/AI/data science roles (AWS, Bedrock, SageMaker, QuickSight, RAG, CI/CD, Docker). No category is ≥1 point lower than the highest, so the averaged score yields the maximum.
Alignment: Extracted requirements: design/implement/manage cloud solutions; stakeholder collaboration; deploy scalable, secure architectures; integrate Azure services with existing systems; lead on‑premises→cloud migrations. Actual Output shows strong AWS architecture and implementation experience (explicitly designed secure, scalable AWS architectures; built/deployed a pipeline processing >1M records with a 5× faster feedback-to-action metric; fine-tuned models with measurable accuracy/toxicity improvements) and some Azure exposure (configured/tested Azure environments), but it lacks explicit Azure integration with existing systems and no evidence of leading on‑premises migrations. Match score was ~64% (3 explicit, 3 implied, 1 absent), mapped to the mid 50–74% band; no boilerplate penalty applied and +1 bonus given for clear measurable outcomes and explicit tool use, resulting in the returned rating.
Impact: Strong use of active verbs and multiple concrete metrics (e.g., built a pipeline processing over 1M feedback records, enabled 5× faster feedback-to-action turnaround, achieved a 5% accuracy improvement and 8% reduction in toxicity, 96% cohort graduation rate), which demonstrates measurable results and ownership. Some bullets remain unquantified or high‑level (e.g., “Designed and presented secure, scalable AWS architectures” and “Configured and tested Azure environments”), introducing mild vagueness. Overall the response ties outcomes to business impact and shows clear ownership, so it merits a high score.

Minor nitpick: small naming inconsistency (""Postgre"") and occasional bullet punctuation variation. Average = (5+5+5)/3 = 5, mapped to a 0–10 scale = 10.
Alignment: Following the evaluation steps: responsibilities score strong for cloud architecture/design/implementation and Azure integration (explicitly lists Azure services, configured Azure environments, presented secure/scalable architectures) but misses leading on‑prem→cloud migrations; tools match is good for Azure and broad cloud (Azure services exact, AWS present as partial), and outcomes include concrete metrics (1M+ record pipeline, 5× faster feedback loops, model accuracy/toxicity improvements) though no migration metrics. No generic-content penalty applied (role/company-specific language and quantified results present). Overall weighted match ≈60%, mapping to the mid score reflecting solid cloud/Azure skills but missing explicit migration leadership.
Impact: High use of action-oriented ownership language (e.g., Designed, Built, Automated, Fine-tuned, Configured, Managed, Delivered) across role bullets, satisfying step 1.

Tone: Professionalism rated high for formal tone, clear structure, and good grammar (clean header, summary, education, and skills). Action-oriented strong: bullets use active verbs and quantified impacts (e.g., “processing over 1M records,” “enhancing feedback loops by 5x,” “96% graduation rate,” “reduced application time by 60%”). Persona alignment is excellent for cloud/data/solutions roles (AWS Solutions Architect intern, relevant certs, FastAPI/OpenAI project). Category scores: Professionalism=5, Action-Oriented=5, Persona Alignment=5 → average 5.0; no two categories differ by more than 1. Only minor note: a single line targeting “Capital One” narrows audience but does not detract significantly from fit.
Alignment: Step 1 (responsibilities): The resume only generically claims Android experience and collaboration but shows no Android-specific engineering or lead responsibilities (no Kotlin/Android SDK/architecture leadership, no mobile-specific projects), so ~40% match → 2.0/5. Step 2 (tools/technologies): Resume lists Java, AWS, CI/CD, Git and Docker which partially align with a transformation-focused Android role, roughly 50% tool match → 1.25/2.5. Step 3 (outcomes/metrics): The resume contains measurable results (1M-record pipeline, 5x feedback loop, 60% time reduction, 96% graduation) but these are not tied to Android/lead responsibilities, so low match (~25%) → 0.625/2.5. Subtotal = 3.875. Applied penalty (-3) for being generic and not tailored to a Lead Android role (missing role-specific language and Android technical details). Final rounded score (bounded 1–10): 1.
Impact: Strong presence of explicit, action-oriented statements with measurable outcomes — e.g., automated sentiment-analysis pipeline processing over 1M records and enhancing feedback loops by 5x; fine‑tuned models improving accuracy ~5% and reducing toxicity ~8%; Alfred cut application time by 60%; delivered 36 lessons to 200+ learners with a 96% graduation rate. Language is active and metric-driven. Minor shortcoming: a few bullets (POCs, some cloud/configuration items) lack clear numeric or business-impact context, so not perfectly comprehensive across every item.

Persona Alignment: excellent — skills and experiences map directly to solutions-architect/data roles (AWS services, ETL, microservices, CI/CD, relevant internships and certifications). Scores are consistent (no meaningful gap between categories); average of the three 1–5 sub-scores is 5.0. Minor shortcoming: could add one-line technical specifics (tools, scale/metrics for architecture choices) to further strengthen technical depth.
Alignment: Strengths: Resume shows strong hands-on technical skills and measurable results — exact language matches for Python, C++, Java, JavaScript (4 of 5 required languages), AWS (EC2, S3, Lambda), microservices/distributed systems, CI/CD and Docker. It includes multiple concrete metrics (1M+ records / 5x faster, 30%/40%/50% improvements, 96% graduation, Alfred: 60% time reduction / +300% apps), which scores highly on outcomes. Responsibility match: explicitly matches hands-on coding (critical), cloud/architecture & distributed systems (critical/optional), and CI/CD/automation (optional) — roughly 3 strong matches and 2 additional partial matches; however, key managerial responsibilities are missing: no evidence of recruiting/managing technical teams, performance management, owning roadmaps/org design, or coordinating large cross-functional efforts. Tools/process gaps: exact matches for major languages and AWS, but missing PHP, LAMP/CDN mentions, explicit storage/cache design, and demonstrated large-scale internet architecture operations. Qualification gaps: Master’s is in-progress (expected 2026) and the resume is internship-heavy, so it likely falls short of the JD’s minimum 3 years of hands-on technical management experience. Scoring rationale: responsibility match low (≈1/3), tools moderate (≈2/3), outcomes high (≈3/3) with a deduction for lack of managerial/mid-senior alignment and limited tailoring to a Software Engineering Manager role, yielding the final score.
Impact: Most bullets contain an action verb, a clear measurable result, and a business outcome (e.g., “Automated sentiment-analysis pipeline processing 1M+ records, achieving 5x faster feedback loops”; “Developed API integrations…improving project delivery timelines by 30%”; “Configured Azure…enhancing deployment efficiency by 40%”; “Automated troubleshooting…reducing manual workload by 50%”; “Achieved 96% cohort graduation rate for 200+ learners”; “Reduced application time by 60%, boosting weekly applications by 300%”). Metrics are specific (numbers and percentages), earning the highest metric-quality adjustment. Minor deductions for a few vague/qualitative phrases (e.g., “enhancing scalability for enterprise customers,” “excellent service reviews”) that lack quantification, but overall the output strongly meets the evaluation criteria.

Persona Alignment: 5 — content and tone closely match a Solutions Architect / cloud & AI candidate (extensive AWS, Bedrock, SageMaker, serverless, RAG, CI/CD details). Computed average: 5.0 — all three aspects scored equally high (no single weak area).
Alignment: Strengths: Direct matches for core cloud architecture & security responsibilities—resume shows Solutions Architect experience, an AWS Solutions Architect certification, designed secure/scalable AWS architectures, performed cost analysis, and delivered quantified outcomes (built a sentiment pipeline processing >1M records with 5× faster feedback, SageMaker fine-tuning with measurable accuracy/toxicity improvements, and CI/CD/Docker deployment in projects). Collaboration evidence exists (designed and presented solutions to enterprise clients). Tools: strong named AWS stack (Lambda, Glue, Athena, QuickSight, SageMaker, Bedrock) and developer tools (Git, Docker). Shortcomings: The job emphasizes Azure integration and leading on-premises→cloud migrations; Azure appears only briefly (one intern role “configured and tested Azure environments”) and Azure is not listed in the primary cloud expertise section—this is a close paraphrase at best. There is no explicit evidence of leading migrations of on‑prem workloads or deep Azure-system integration with existing enterprise systems, and no tailoring to Dickinson Financial or financial-domain context. Given high specificity and quantified results but missing key Azure/migration responsibilities and limited tailoring, the overall alignment is moderate.
Impact: Many bullets use strong action verbs with clear, specific metrics and business impact: e.g., built an automated sentiment pipeline processing over 1M records enabling a 5× faster feedback-to-action turnaround; fine-tuned models for a 5% accuracy increase and 8% reduction in toxicity/hallucinations; project-level results showing a 60% reduction in application time and a 300% increase in completed applications; delivered 36 lessons to 200+ learners with a 96% graduation rate.

Core Skills/Technical Expertise — the listed cloud, ML, AI, security, tooling and project technologies (AWS services including Bedrock/SageMaker/Glue/QuickSight, FastAPI, PostgreSQL+pgvector, OpenAI GPT-4.1 mini, Docker, CI/CD, Python libraries, etc.) are all present in the Retrieval Context and are VERIFIED → 10/10. Aggregating subscores with the fabrication penalty yields an overall credibility rating of 8 — strong verification for experience and technical skills, reduced by the contradicted Dean’s List count in education which drove the penalty.",203,2025-12-18 19:48:52.575658,9,8
114,1636,P0,10,10,6,45,"Punctuality: The score is 1.00 because the 'Contradictions' list is empty, indicating no inconsistencies and the actual output fully aligns with the retrieval context.
Tone: Professionalism 5/5: clear, formal resume formatting with correct grammar, consistent headings, and concise bullets. Action-Oriented 5/5: heavy use of strong verbs (Designed, Built, Automated, Fine-tuned) and multiple quantified outcomes (sentiment pipeline processing 1M+ records, 5× faster feedback loops, ~5% accuracy gain, ~8% toxicity reduction, 96% cohort graduation). Persona Alignment 5/5: terminology and emphasis strongly match solutions-architect/data+AI roles (AWS services including Bedrock/SageMaker/Glue, RAG, CI/CD, FastAPI, pgvector) and the seniority/experience level shown by internships and relevant projects. Average of the three component scores is 5; scaled to the requested 0–10 range yields 10.
Alignment: Resume matches design/implementation and stakeholder collaboration responsibilities (designed AWS architectures, presented to enterprise customers; configured Azure App Service/Functions/Storage; built POCs and automated a sentiment pipeline processing 1M+ records with 5× faster feedback; model improvements ~+5% accuracy, −8% toxicity), giving strong tools/outcomes evidence, but it lacks explicit leadership of on‑premises→cloud migrations and concrete Azure migration/integration metrics (AWS‑heavy focus). Calculated weighted match ≈52% (responsibilities ~64%, tools ~50%, outcomes ~37%) with no generic‑content penalty, mapped to a score of 6.
Impact: Strong use of action-oriented language (multiple clear ownership verbs: Designed, Built, Automated, Fine-tuned, Developed, Implemented, Established) and concrete tasks across roles. Contains several precise measurable results (processed 1M+ records, 5× faster feedback loops, ~5% accuracy gain, ~8% toxicity reduction, 36 lessons for 200+ learners, 96% graduation rate) with internship timeframes noted, though few metrics tie directly to revenue/cost figures. Business impact is mainly efficiency and learning outcomes rather than explicit financial KPIs. Wording is predominantly active, so no major passive-voice penalty applied.
CredTail: All claimed items in the Actual Output are supported by the Retrieval Context. Degrees: Master of Science (CUNY SPS, Expected Jan 2026) and Bachelor of Technology (CUNY NYC College of Technology, Jun 2024) — Verified. Employers and dates: Solutions Architect Intern at Amazon Web Services (Arlington, VA) Jun 2025–Sep 2025; Software Developer Intern at WOPLLI Technologies Jun 2024–Sep 2024; IT Support Intern at Mayor’s Office of Information Services Feb 2024–May 2024; IT Instructor Assistant at RF CUNY & Generation USA Feb 2022–Aug 2023 — all Verified (dates and highlights match). Core technologies/core competencies (Python with pandas/scikit-learn/PyTorch, SQL/NoSQL, AWS services including Bedrock/SageMaker/Glue/QuickSight, Azure services, FastAPI, PostgreSQL+pgvector, Docker, CI/CD, etc.) are present in the Retrieval Context — Verified. No claims were Missing, Contradicted, or Fabricated. Initial credibility was 100% (mapped to the top scale), and no penalties applied, so the final integer score is the maximum.",202,2025-12-18 19:48:57.779027,9,10
115,1008,P2,9.473684210526315,9,2,33.473684210526315,"Punctuality: The score is 0.95 because the actual output mislabels and misdates the Mayor’s Office position — the retrieval lists the role as 'IT Support Intern' at the Mayor’s Office of Information Services from Feb 2024–May 2024 (not current) rather than 'Volunteer IT Support and Development Intern' — and it underreports device work by claiming restoration of over 400 devices while the retrieval shows refurbishing and tracking over 800 devices.
Tone: Professionalism 4/5 — generally clear and grammatical but formatting and consistency issues (all-caps name, mixed date/formatting, minor polish issues) reduce formality. Action-Oriented 5/5 — uses strong verbs and result-focused language with measurable outcomes (restored 400+ devices, 96% cohort graduation, 65,000+ records). Persona Alignment 5/5 — technical vocabulary, tools, certifications, and projects align well with an IT/engineering role. Averaged score maps to 9/10. Flag: Professionalism is 1 point lower than the highest category, indicating a small imbalance in polish vs. content strength.
Alignment: Resume meets about 31% of the job’s discrete requirements (3 explicit matches: mentoring, SQL work, web/client-server knowledge; ~7 implied matches: systems analysis/SDLC/Agile partial, team communication, triage, multitasking, facilitation), but lacks many core BA specifics (no JAD/interview/shadowing, no explicit user stories with acceptance criteria, no interface/source-to-target mapping, no JIRA or vendor API experience, no HR/eCommerce BSA background) and fails the on-site location requirement. I applied a penalty for generic/boilerplate content and ignoring the on-site/location constraint, with a small bonus for clear measurable outcomes (96% cohort graduation, restoring 400 devices) and explicit SQL/SDLC/Agile references.
Impact: The output contains multiple explicit action verbs and concrete metrics (restored 400+ devices, taught 36 lessons to 200+ learners, 96% cohort graduation rate, generated reports from 65,000+ records), which supports a high base score. Some lines use weaker phrasing (e.g., “Provide support,” “Participate”) that slightly reduce clear ownership, but overall the results tie to measurable operational and learning outcomes, so the final score reflects minor deduction for passive wording and positive adjustment for clear business impact.
CredTail: Verified: name, email, LinkedIn, location, degree/institution (Bachelor of Technology, NYC College of Technology), IT Instructor Assistant role and dates (Feb 2022–Aug 2023) and certifications match the Retrieval Context. Partial/Conflicting: phone number appears in Retrieval Artifacts but conflicts with the Structured Profile (Actual matches artifact, not structured value); GPA and graduation month differ slightly (3.8 vs 3.78; May 2024 vs Jun 2024); Mayor’s Office role content matches but dates and device counts conflict (Actual: 02/2024–Current and ~400 devices; Retrieval: Feb–May 2024 and ~800 devices) — marked partial/mismatch. Missing/Fabricated: two internships in the Retrieval Context (AWS Solutions Architect Intern Jun–Sep 2025 and WOPLLI Technologies Jun–Sep 2024) are absent from the Actual Output; projects listed in the Actual Output (Financial Stocks Report, EzRental) are not present in the Retrieval Context (treated as missing/fabricated). Core technologies: overlap on Python, SQL, Active Directory and AWS generally (partial match), but many advanced/cloud/ML skills in Retrieval (Bedrock, SageMaker, Glue, etc.) are not reflected in the Actual Output. Because several critical items are missing or inconsistent (employers and dates, fabricated/missing projects, and notable core-skill gaps), I penalized substantially and selected a low-mid credibility score.",209,2025-12-18 19:49:00.733057,9,4

Tone: High professionalism: formal tone, clear structure, and correct grammar across sections. Strong action-orientation: uses active verbs and multiple quantified impacts (e.g., processing over 1M records, 5× faster feedback-to-action, 5% accuracy gain, 8% toxicity reduction, 96% cohort graduation). Excellent persona alignment: clear cloud/solutions-architect and data/ML focus (AWS, Azure, SageMaker, RAG, FastAPI) that matches the target role and seniority. Category scores are consistent with one another (no two differ by more than one), indicating a coherent, well-aligned resume.
Alignment: Strong alignment with responsibilities: the resume demonstrates designing/implementing/managing cloud solutions, stakeholder collaboration, scalable/secure architectures, Azure integration, and an on‑prem→cloud migration (matched across required duties) — full credit on Step 1. Tools/technologies match: Azure and cloud platform services (and related AWS services) are explicitly listed, satisfying the job’s platform needs (full credit on Step 2). Outcomes/metrics present but partially tied to the core migration/integration responsibility: measurable results include a 1M‑record sentiment pipeline with 5× faster turnaround, 5% accuracy gain and 8% toxicity reduction, and a 96% cohort graduation rate, but there is no explicit KPI showing migration impact or Azure integration outcomes (partial credit on Step 3). The resume is tailored with role‑specific language and a finance focus, so no penalty applied. Combined weighted score rounds to a 9.
Impact: Strong presence of explicit, action-oriented results with clear metrics: e.g., “processed over 1M feedback records” yielding “5× faster feedback-to-action,” model tuning that produced a 5% accuracy gain and 8% toxicity reduction, and a 96% cohort graduation rate after delivering 36 lessons to 200+ learners. These are specific, measurable outcomes tied to business/operational impact, meeting the rubric’s top tier. Minor shortcomings: a few bullets remain vague (e.g., “enhancing operational efficiency and data accessibility,” Azure/configuration tasks and the virtual credential system lack quantifiable impact) and occasional passive phrasing, so a small penalty was applied.
CredTail: Most claims are directly supported: personal info, both degrees (Master expected Jan 2026 and Bachelor Jun 2024), all employers and employment dates (AWS Jun–Sep 2025, WOPLLI Jun–Sep 2024, Mayor’s Office Feb–May 2024, RF CUNY/Generation Feb 2022–Aug 2023), project tech (FastAPI, PostgreSQL/pgvector, GPT‑4.1 mini, Docker, CI/CD) and AWS/Azure services (including SageMaker) appear in the retrieval context. Deductions were applied for two discrepancies: the Bachelor’s Dean’s List count is listed as 8× in the Actual Output but is 5× in the retrieval (contradicted/fabricated), and Tableau is listed as a visualization skill in the Actual Output but is not present in the retrieval context (missing/fabricated).",200,2025-12-18 19:50:28.742338,9,8
117,1162,P4,10,10,1,35,"Punctuality: The score is 1.00 because the Contradictions list is empty, indicating there are no inconsistencies between the actual output and the retrieval context — well done.
Tone: All three evaluation dimensions scored at the top end. Professionalism: very clean, consistent formatting and grammar with clear sections (header, summary, skills, experience, projects, education). Action-Oriented: strong use of action verbs and measurable outcomes (e.g., “processed 1M+ records,” “5× faster,” “5% accuracy,” “60% reduction,” “300% increase,” “96% graduation rate”), showing quantified impact. Persona Alignment: excellent fit for cloud/data/solutions roles given AWS certifications, SageMaker/model tuning experience, cloud services listed, and relevant internships/projects. No notable shortcomings beyond opportunities to add deeper technical specifics in a few bullets for senior-level roles.
Alignment: Responsibility match: Almost none of the Android/lead-specific responsibilities from the Capital One job are present — no Android app development, Android SDK/Studio, Kotlin, mobile UI/performance work, or leadership/mentorship responsibilities are shown (critical items missing). Tools/technologies: Partial matches only — Java, CI/CD, AWS and Agile are listed, but must-have Android tools (Kotlin, Android SDK/Studio, Gradle) are absent. Outcomes/metrics: Resume contains strong, concrete metrics (e.g., 1M+ records, 5× faster pipeline, model accuracy +5%, Alfred: 60% time reduction) but these are tied to cloud/ML/data projects, not Android responsibilities. Overall scoring: very low responsibility alignment, some tool overlap, good measurable outcomes but not relevant to the role; additionally resume is not tailored to Capital One/Android lead role (generic language) — this justifies a low final score.
Impact: Strong presence of action verbs plus measurable results and business outcomes across multiple bullets (e.g., automated sentiment-analysis pipeline processing 1M+ records with 5× faster feedback loops; fine-tuned SageMaker models improving accuracy by 5% and reducing toxicity by 8%; Alfred reduced application time by 60% and boosted weekly applications by 300%; delivered 36 lessons to 200+ learners with a 96% graduation rate). Metrics are precise and time-bound where provided (adds quality). Minor weaknesses: several bullets use vague phrasing or lack metrics (e.g., “designed AWS architectures… enhancing scalability and security,” “automated troubleshooting workflows… reducing manual workload significantly,” and vendor-management line), so a small penalty was applied for occasional vague language.
CredTail: Strong alignment on high-priority items: name, email, phone, LinkedIn/GitHub links, all four employers and their dates (AWS: Jun 2025–Sep 2025; WOPLLI: Jun 2024–Sep 2024; Mayor’s Office: Feb 2024–May 2024; RF CUNY/Generation USA: Feb 2022–Aug 2023) exactly match the Retrieval Context. Education entries and GPAs (MSc expected Jan 2026; B.Tech Jun 2024) and project metrics/CI-CD claims (Alfred: 60% time reduction, CI/CD pipeline) are supported. Core/cloud/devops skills largely match (Python, SQL/NoSQL, AWS EC2/S3/Lambda, Azure, ETL, Data Modeling, Generative AI, SageMaker references in experience, Docker, CI/CD). Discrepancies: three languages listed in the Actual Output (JavaScript, C#, PHP) are not present in the Retrieval Context and are unsupported (counted as three high-priority technology mismatches). Minor omission: one certification in the Retrieval Context (Google Information Support Certificate) is not listed in the Actual Output (not penalized per rules). Following the deduction rules (start 10; −2 per unsupported technology), the score is reduced for the three unsupported languages.",196,2025-12-18 19:50:29.782813,10,4

Action-Oriented: strong — uses active verbs (Designed, Built, Automated, Fine-tuned) and quantifiable outcomes (sentiment pipeline processing 1M+ records, 5× faster feedback loops, ~5% accuracy improvement, ~8% toxicity reduction, 96% cohort graduation rate). Persona Alignment: strong — content maps well to cloud/AI/data roles (AWS services: Bedrock, SageMaker, Glue/Lambda/Athena; RAG, FastAPI). No category is ≥1 point below the highest score, so no imbalance noted.
Alignment: Resume explicitly demonstrates key AWS data-engineering skills and outcomes: Glue, Athena, Lambda, QuickSight, SageMaker, AWS certification, plus measurable results (1M+ records processed, 5× faster dashboards, ~5% accuracy improvement, -8% toxicity). Against 8 inferred job requirements, 6 were explicit, 1 implied and 1 absent → ~81% match mapped to a high score. Penalized one point for not referencing Capgemini/New Jersey or a Data Engineer title; awarded one-point bonus for concrete metrics and explicit tool use, yielding the final score.
Impact: High score due to multiple explicit action verbs (Designed, Built, Automated, Fine-tuned) and several concrete, measurable results: automated pipeline processing 1M+ records, 5× faster feedback loops, ~5% accuracy improvement, ~8% toxicity reduction, 36 lessons for 200+ learners, and a 96% cohort graduation rate. Ownership is clear (built POCs, automated pipelines, fine-tuned models) and business impact (real-time QuickSight dashboards, actionable sentiment insights) is directly tied to outcomes. Language is active with minimal vagueness, so no significant penalties applied.
CredTail: Cross-check finds high fidelity: degrees are exact matches (CUNY SPS MS Data Science & ML, Expected Jan 2026, GPA 4.0; CUNY NYCCT B.Tech CIS, Jun 2024, GPA 3.78).

Core technologies and project details are consistent with the Retrieval Context (AWS services including Bedrock, Glue, SageMaker; FastAPI, PostgreSQL+pgvector, Docker, OpenAI GPT-4.1 mini; pipeline and RAG details). No fabricated items detected. Minor omissions: one certification listed in the Retrieval Context (Google Information Support Certificate) and some less-central skills (e.g., Macie, PyTorch, R) appear in the source but are not in the Actual Output; these are non-critical. Because all critical fields (degree, employer, dates, core tech) are verified and there are no fabrications, credibility is assessed as maximal.",214,2025-12-18 19:51:30.253939,10,10

Tone: Professionalism 5/5 — consistently formal, well-structured, industry-appropriate tone with only minor inconsistencies (e.g., “Honor's Society”, “MS.Net”). Action-Oriented 5/5 — strong action verbs and quantified outcomes (generated reports from 65,000+ records, restored 400+ devices, 96% cohort graduation) and clear project achievements. Persona Alignment 5/5 — tone and content suit a junior/mid-level software/database developer (relevant projects: Financial Stocks web app, EzRental POS; skills: Java, Python, SQL; internship experience). Average = 5.0/5 → scaled to 10/10. Highest and lowest scores are equal (all 5s); only minor formatting/consistency issues noted.
Alignment: Low alignment. Strengths: resume shows technical skills relevant to integration/analysis (SQL, Oracle/MS SQL/MySQL, ERDs, data dictionaries), SDLC/Agile experience, and concrete project metrics (65,000-record report, 400 devices restored, 96% cohort graduation). Shortcomings: missing core BA responsibilities and artifacts required by the posting—no mention of writing User Stories with Acceptance Criteria, facilitating JAD/UAT, producing source-to-target mappings or interface requirements, or triage for production break/fix; no evidence of 3–5 years of BSA experience; no Atlassian JIRA or vendor API experience; location/on-site requirement (Mechanicsville, VA; 4 days/week) and in-person interview mandate are not addressed. Given partial technical overlap but key role-specific and location requirements are absent, the resume scores low.
Impact: Strong use of action verbs with multiple clear, quantifiable outcomes (e.g., generated stock reports from 65,000+ records; restored over 400 devices; taught 36 lessons to 200+ learners; achieved a 96% cohort graduation rate). Those metrics show scale and impact, but several bullets use vague/passive phrasing (e.g., “Provide support,” “Assist in delivering,” “Communicate…”) and lack business-facing context (no revenue/cost/timeframe baselines for most metrics). The mix of specific measurable results and some passive/unclear statements leads to a high but not perfect alignment with the scoring rules.
CredTail: Education: degree and institution VERIFIED (CUNY NYC College of Technology) but GPA and graduation month are CONTRADICTED (Actual: GPA 3.8, Expected May 2024; Retrieval: GPA 3.78, Jun 2024) — flagged as fabrication/mismatch. Experience: IT Instructor Assistant (Feb 2022–Aug 2023) VERIFIED with matching highlights; Mayor’s Office role has several VERIFIED elements (employer, start date Feb 2024, duties) but the claim “02/2024–Current” and device count (“400+”) are CONTRADICTED by Retrieval (Feb 2024–May 2024; ~800 devices) — treated as fabricated/missing details. Core Skills: many core items VERIFIED (Python, SQL, Oracle, MySQL, Git, AWS, SDLC/Agile) but several claimed technologies are MISSING from the Retrieval Context (Java, JavaScript, C#, PHP, Dart, MS/.NET, Kali OS) and thus penalized. Subscores applied per category (Education ~3/10 after contradictions, Experience ~4/10 due to one contradicted role, Core Skills ~3/10 for numerous missing claims), aggregated to a final credibility assessment driven by the contradicted graduation/date/GPA and the Mayor’s Office “current” status and missing language/.NET claims — resulting in a low overall credibility score.",208,2025-12-18 19:53:19.036389,8,3

Tone: Professional tone is strong with clean grammar and formal vocabulary (clear headings, complete sentences). Action-oriented language and quantified outcomes are consistent—e.g., “built and deployed…processing over 1M feedback records,” “5× faster feedback-to-action,” “5% increase…8% reduction,” and project metrics (60% time reduction, 300% increase). Persona alignment is excellent for cloud/AI Solutions Architect roles: relevant AWS/Azure tooling (Bedrock, SageMaker, QuickSight, Lambda), certifications, and a matching project (Alfred with FastAPI and RAG/pgvector). Calculated average across the three evaluation categories is 5.0, and no two category scores differ by more than one (no inconsistency).
Alignment: Responsibilities: Strong alignment with key duties — resume demonstrates designing/implementing cloud solutions, stakeholder-facing architecture work, scalable/secure architectures, and Azure integration; leadership of on-premises migrations is only asserted in the summary with limited concrete migration project detail (partial match). Tools/technologies: Excellent match to the job’s cloud/tooling requirements — explicit Azure services (App Service, Functions, Storage) plus AWS services (EC2, S3, Lambda, Glue, SageMaker, Bedrock) are listed. Outcomes/metrics: Strong presence of measurable results tied to responsibilities (1M+ record pipeline, 5× faster feedback-to-action, 5% accuracy gain, 8% reduction in hallucinations/toxicity, 60% time reduction, 300% increase in completed applications). No generic-tailoring penalty applies. Based on the weighted evaluation (responsibilities mostly matched, full tools and outcomes match, minor shortfall on documented migration leadership), the resume earns a high score.
Impact: Strong presence of action-oriented, measurable accomplishments: e.g., built an automated sentiment pipeline processing over 1M records enabling 5× faster feedback-to-action turnaround; fine-tuned models for a 5% accuracy gain and 8% reduction in toxicity/hallucinations; Alfred project cut application time by 60% and increased completed applications by 300%; 96% cohort graduation rate and explicit GPAs. These are concrete metrics tied to outcomes. Minor deduction for occasional lack of baseline/context for some percentages and a few mildly passive phrasings that slightly reduce clarity of business impact.

Tone: Professionalism: very strong — clear, well-formatted resume with correct grammar, links, and sectioning. Action-oriented: uses strong verbs (Designed, Built, Fine-tuned, Automated, Developed) and provides quantified impacts (processed 1M+ records, 5x faster feedback, +5% accuracy, -8% toxicity, 96% cohort graduation, 60% time reduction, 300% more applications). Persona alignment: excellent fit for cloud/ML/AI roles (AWS, SageMaker, Generative AI, cloud and security skills). All three component scores are consistent (no gap), yielding an average of 5.0 (mapped to the top score).
Alignment: The resume matches several JD responsibilities: explicit design of secure, scalable cloud architectures (AWS Solutions Architect Intern) and hands-on Azure configuration for app hosting (Software Developer Intern) — these map to designing/implementing and Azure integration (critical). Missing or not explicit: leading migrations of on‑premises workloads and stakeholder collaboration/solution ownership (critical gaps). Tools: strong AWS tool coverage (EC2, S3, Lambda, RDS, DynamoDB, Glue, QuickSight) and Azure experience shown in internship, but Azure is not listed in the Cloud expertise section (partial tools mismatch). Outcomes: excellent measurable results present (1M+ records, 5x faster pipeline, +5% model accuracy, -8% toxicity, 60% reduced application time, 300% more applications, 96% graduation rate) — strong alignment. Scoring balances responsibility matches (medium), tools (partial), and measurable outcomes (high), with a one-point deduction for lack of explicit migration leadership and limited tailoring to the role/company.
Impact: Strong use of action verbs plus measurable results and clear business outcomes in multiple bullets (e.g., “Built automated sentiment analysis pipeline processing 1M+ records, enabling 5x faster feedback”; “Fine-tuned models… improving accuracy by 5% and reducing toxicity by 8%”; “Reduced application time by 60% and increased weekly applications by 300%”; “Delivered 36 lessons to 200+ learners, achieving a 96% graduation rate”) — this satisfies the action+metric+outcome criterion. Metric quality is high (precise numbers/percentages), so full credit on specificity. Minor issues: a few bullets lack metrics or use vague wording (e.g., “reducing manual workload significantly,” “Designed secure, scalable AWS architectures,” “Configured Azure environments”), so a small penalty for vagueness. Overall assessment yields a top score after adding specificity points and applying the minor vagueness penalty.
CredTail: Score reflects strong alignment on identity, education degrees/dates, internships, and project details but several discrepancies with the Retrieval Context led to deductions.

Persona Alignment: excellent match to cloud/data/ML/solutions-architect roles with AWS/SageMaker/Bedrock, data pipeline and generative-AI emphasis. Given these strengths across all three evaluation steps, the averaged rating corresponds to the highest score.
Alignment: Responsibilities partially match (e.g., systems design, ETL/data-flow diagrams, troubleshooting, SDLC/Agile listed) but core BA items are missing or implicit (no JAD/interviews, no explicit user stories/acceptance criteria, no source→target mapping docs, no UAT facilitation, no build-vs-buy/cost‑benefit work); tools match is mixed (strong SQL, APIs/Postman/Swagger, AWS/Glue; missing Atlassian JIRA and HR/e‑commerce experience); measurable outcomes are present (1M+ record pipeline, 5× faster feedback, model accuracy gains) but resume reflects early‑career internships and omits stated years for required BA experience, and a 10% generic‑content penalty was applied, yielding a final mapped score of 5.
Impact: High active ownership: numerous strong action verbs (designed, built, automated, fine-tuned, developed, refurbished, delivered) describing concrete tasks and ownership across roles. Strong measurable results: multiple explicit metrics and timeframes (processed 1M+ records; 5× faster feedback loops; ~5% accuracy improvement; ~8% toxicity reduction; refurbished 800+ devices; 100+ tickets; 36 lessons for 200+ learners; 96% graduation rate; internship dates present). Business impact is present and tied to outcomes (faster feedback loops, improved model quality, operational efficiency), but not consistently quantified in financial terms or with baselines for all improvements, so impact is sometimes implied rather than fully contextualized. Passive voice is minimal, so no major deduction.
CredTail: All claims in the Actual Output were supported by the Retrieval Context. Degrees: Master of Science (Data Science & ML, CUNY SPS, Expected Jan 2026, GPA 4.0, Dean’s List 2x) and Bachelor of Technology (Computer Information Systems, CUNY NYC College of Technology, Jun 2024, GPA 3.78, Dean’s List, National Honor Society) — Verified. Employers and employment dates: AWS (Solutions Architect Intern, Jun 2025–Sep 2025), WOPLLI Technologies (Software Developer Intern, Jun 2024–Sep 2024), Mayor’s Office of Information Services (IT Support Intern, Feb 2024–May 2024), RF CUNY & Generation USA (IT Instructor Assistant, Feb 2022–Aug 2023) — all Verified. Core technologies/skills (Python, pandas, scikit-learn, PyTorch, SQL/NoSQL, AWS services including EC2/S3/Lambda/RDS/DynamoDB/Glue/QuickSight/Bedrock/Macie/SageMaker, Azure services, ETL/ELT, Generative AI, QuickSight/Power BI, Docker, FastAPI, PostgreSQL, etc.) match the Retrieval Context — Verified. No Missing, Contradicted, or Fabricated claims were identified. Verified count = total claimed (100%) → initial credibility mapped to top scale. No penalties applied, so final score is 10.",207,2025-12-18 19:53:59.809537,9,10
123,472,P2,9.230769230769232,9,6,39.23076923076923,"Punctuality: The score is 0.92 because the actual output mislabels the Mayor’s Office role as “Volunteer IT Support and Development Intern” and marks it as current, whereas the retrieval context lists an IT Support Intern from Feb 2024 to May 2024; and it understates device work by saying “restoring over 400 devices” instead of refurbishing/tracking 800+ devices as shown in the profile.
Tone: Professionalism rated high for clear formatting, correct grammar, consistent tone, and polished sections (Summary, Skills, Experience, Education, Certifications, Projects). Action-Oriented scored slightly lower because many bullets use weaker verbs (“Provide,” “Assist,” “Participate,” “Deploy”) rather than stronger result-focused phrasing, though there are solid measurable outcomes (restored over 400 devices, taught 36 lessons to 200+ learners, 96% graduation). Persona Alignment is strong: technical vocabulary (AWS, FastAPI, pgvector, PyTorch), relevant certifications, and a project demonstrating generative-AI tooling closely match the target technologist/data-engineer persona. Minor imbalance flagged: Action-Oriented is one point below the highest category, so emphasizing stronger action verbs and clearer impact metrics across all experience bullets would improve parity.
Alignment: Strong matches for Python, SQL, ETL/ELT (Glue, SSIS), RDBMS/data modeling and NYC location, but resume lacks explicit PySpark and PL/SQL, shows no clear Big Data/warehouse experience or explicit onsite-3-days availability, and most relevant experience is volunteer/junior—resulting in a moderate match (~65%).
Impact: Strong alignment: resume contains multiple clear metrics and explicit action verbs (e.g., “participate”/“deploy”/“developed”/“implemented”), with concrete accomplishments such as restoring over 400 devices, teaching 36 lessons to 200+ learners, and a 96% cohort graduation rate, plus project details (FastAPI + GPT-4 Mini, PostgreSQL + pgvector). Minor shortcoming is absence of explicit dollar/time-saved ROI on outcomes, but ownership and business-impact linkage are explicit, warranting a top score.
CredTail: Verified: personal info (name, email, phone, LinkedIn, GitHub, NY location) and high-level summary match; education entries (MS expected Jan 2026, BS Jun 2024) including GPAs/honors match; certifications and the Alfred project details largely match; IT Instructor Assistant entry (Feb 2022–Aug 2023) and its metrics match. Partial matches: core skills overlap (Python, SQL/NoSQL, ETL/Glue, DBs) but omit many specific AWS/Generative AI/Azure items present in the Retrieval Context. Missing: two employer roles present in Retrieval Context (Solutions Architect Intern at AWS Jun 2025–Sep 2025 and Software Developer Intern at WOPLLI Jun 2024–Sep 2024) are absent from the Actual Output. Fabricated/contradictory items: Mayor’s Office role title/dates extended to “02/2024 – Current” versus Retrieval’s Feb 2024–May 2024, and device count differs (Actual: ~400 restored vs Retrieval: ~800 refurbished/tracked) — these are material inconsistencies. Because several key employer entries are missing and there are fabricated/contradictory employment details and omissions of specific core technologies, credibility is reduced accordingly.",219,2025-12-18 19:54:15.693987,10,5
124,575,P1,10,10,8,46,"Punctuality: The score is 1.00 because the Contradictions list is empty, indicating no discrepancies between the actual output and the retrieval context, so the output fully aligns. Well done.
Tone: Professionalism rated 5 — consistently formal, well-structured, industry-appropriate language with clear headings, certifications, and education entries. Action-Oriented rated 5 — frequent strong verbs and quantified accomplishments (e.g., automated pipeline processing 1M records enabling 5× faster feedback-to-action; fine-tuned models +5% accuracy/−8% toxicity; Alfred project reduced apply time 60% and increased applications 300%). Persona Alignment rated 5 — resume tone and content align tightly with a Solutions Architect/Data/AI candidate (AWS, Bedrock, SageMaker, Glue, QuickSight). The average across the three categories is at the maximum and all categories are equal; only minor issues are stylistic (link formatting) rather than substantive.
Alignment: Evaluation followed the steps: extracted required items from the AWS Data Engineer listing (AWS cloud experience, building automated ETL/data pipelines, Glue/Athena/SQL, serverless/Lambda, data visualization, data governance/security, certifications, consulting/client-facing tailoring). Resume matches many items directly: explicit AWS services (Glue, Athena, Lambda, S3, EC2, QuickSight, SageMaker), ETL/ELT and automated pipelines (1M+ records pipeline), and relevant certifications (AWS Solutions Architect, AWS AI Practitioner). It includes strong specificity and measurable outcomes (1M records processed, 5× faster feedback-to-action, 60% time reduction for job applications), and concrete projects (RAG system, deployed CI/CD). Shortcomings: no mention of Capgemini or tailored consulting/enterprise delivery experience, and several common data-engineer tools/frameworks often requested (Redshift, Kinesis, EMR, Airflow, Terraform) are missing; resume leans toward solutions architecture/ML rather than pure data-engineer consulting. Combined match rate, strong quantification, and missing company/role tailoring support a high but not perfect score.
Impact: Strong alignment: the output includes multiple bullets with clear action verbs and specific, measurable results tied to business impact (e.g., processing over 1M feedback records enabling a 5× faster feedback-to-action turnaround; a 5% accuracy gain and 8% toxicity reduction from model fine-tuning; a 60% time reduction and 300% increase in completed applications; 96% cohort graduation rate). It contains many distinct quantifiable outcomes across experience and projects, emphasizing efficiency, accuracy, and throughput. Deductions for several passive or vague bullets that lack metrics or baselines (e.g., “designed and presented secure, scalable AWS architectures,” “configured and tested Azure environments,” “automated troubleshooting…reducing manual workload” without a percent or time), and a few metrics lack explicit baselines or timeframes. Overall, the resume demonstrates strong measurable results with some recurring non-quantified items.
CredTail: Education: VERIFIED — both degrees match the Retrieval Context exactly (CUNY SPS MS Data Science & ML expected Jan 2026, GPA 4.0; CUNY NYC College of Technology BTech June 2024, GPA 3.78, Dean’s List 5x, National Honor Society). Experience: VERIFIED — all four roles (Solutions Architect Intern at AWS Jun 2025–Sep 2025; Software Developer Intern at WOPLLI Jun 2024–Sep 2024; IT Support Intern Feb 2024–May 2024; IT Instructor Assistant Feb 2022–Aug 2023) and their highlighted achievements align with the Retrieval Context. Core Skills/Projects: Largely VERIFIED — detailed AWS services (EC2, S3, Lambda, RDS, DynamoDB, Glue, QuickSight, Bedrock, Macie, SageMaker), Python libraries, FastAPI + OpenAI GPT-4.1 mini project, PostgreSQL+pgvector, Docker, CI/CD, and other listed technologies are present in the Retrieval Context. Missing items/fabrications: Languages (English — Fluent; Spanish — Fluent) are not present in the Retrieval Context (marked MISSING). No direct contradictions found. Subscores (0–10) by category based on proportion verified: Education 10, Experience 10, Core Skills 8 (strong penalty applied for the missing language claims). Aggregate result yields a final credibility rating driven by near-complete verification of education, experience, and technical claims with one missing item lowering a perfect score.",213,2025-12-18 19:56:13.750149,9,9
125,1636,P4,9.736842105263158,9,4,36.73684210526316,"Punctuality: The score is 0.97 because the only contradictions are a minor numeric mismatch — the retrieval shows Dean’s List (5x) for the Bachelor’s entry while the actual output listed Dean’s List (8x) — and an issue with National Honor Society (the retrieval shows it as present but the actual output did not reflect that).
Tone: Professionalism: 4 — clear, grammatical, and well-structured with defined sections and contact links, but minor formatting inconsistencies (ALL-CAPS header, some terse bullets, timeline formatting). Action-Oriented: 5 — strongly action-driven with many strong verbs and quantified impacts (e.g., 1M+ records, 5× faster feedback, +5% accuracy, −8% toxicity, 60% time reduction, 300% increase in applications). Persona Alignment: 5 — excellent fit for cloud/ML/solutions-architect roles with relevant tools and technologies (AWS, SageMaker, FastAPI, GPT-4.1). Largest gap is one point between Professionalism and the other two scores; overall the ratings are consistent and the output effectively highlights measurable accomplishments and role alignment.
Alignment: The resume partially aligns with the Solutions Architect JD. Responsibilities: critical task of designing secure, scalable cloud architectures is explicitly present (Solutions Architect Intern at AWS) and configuring/implementing cloud environments is shown (Azure configuration at WOPLLI) — scored as partial/full matches — but leading on‑premises workload migration and explicit stakeholder collaboration/integration of Azure services with existing systems are not demonstrated. Tools/technologies: AWS services are well-detailed (EC2, S3, Lambda, RDS, Glue, SageMaker) and Azure is listed generically, but no Azure-specific services or migration tools (e.g., Azure Migrate, Azure AD integration details) are shown, so must-have Azure migration tooling is missing. Outcomes/metrics: strong — multiple concrete results (1M+ records, 5× faster feedback, 5% model accuracy gain, 8% toxicity reduction, 60% time reduction, 300% increase in applications, 96% graduation rate). Scoring rationale: good responsibility coverage (partial), weak tools alignment for Azure migration, excellent measurable outcomes — after weighting these areas and subtracting points for missing migration evidence and limited company-specific tailoring, the overall alignment is low-to-moderate.
Impact: Many bullets contain action verbs + measurable results + business outcomes (e.g., “Automated sentiment analysis pipeline processing 1M+ records, enabling 5× faster feedback”; “Fine-tuned models… improving accuracy by 5% and reducing toxicity by 8%”; “Reduced application time by 60% and increased weekly applications by 300%”), satisfying the highest tier of the first step. Metric quality is strong with precise counts and percentages, so full bonus points apply. Minor deductions for a few vague statements without outcomes or metrics (e.g., “Designed secure, scalable AWS architectures…” and “reducing manual workload significantly”), so a small penalty is applied. Overall the output is specific, measurable, and business-focused but contains a few generic lines.
CredTail: Strong alignment on core identity, contacts, links, education degrees (MS expected Jan 2026; B.Tech June 2024) and GPAs, internship employers/titles/dates (AWS Jun–Sep 2025; WOPLLI Jun–Sep 2024; Mayor’s Office Feb–May 2024; IT Instructor Feb 2022–Aug 2023), project “Alfred” (FastAPI + OpenAI GPT-4.1) and many core skills (Python, AWS EC2/S3/Lambda/RDS/Glue/QuickSight, SageMaker in experience, Azure, Power BI/Tableau, Git/Docker). Discrepancies: (1) Missing / not listed in Actual but present in Retrieval core skills: Bedrock and DynamoDB (high‑priority core tech items) — counted as two missing technologies. (2) Education honor mismatch: Bachelor’s Dean’s List count (Retrieval 5x vs Actual 8x) — contradiction/unsupported claim. (3) Retrieval also lists an additional certification (Google Information Support Certificate) that Actual omits (not primary but noted). Dates are consistent across records. Scoring: start 10, deduct 2 points for each missing high‑priority core technology (−4) and 2 points for the contradictory Dean’s List count (−2) = final score 4. Recommend source verification for the omitted Bedrock/DynamoDB skills and the Dean’s List claim/certification.",206,2025-12-18 19:56:38.447364,10,4
126,1008,P3,7.5,9,2,32.5,"Punctuality: The score is 0.75 because the actual output contains multiple specific contradictions with the retrieval: it lists phone 929-305-7353 while the structured profile phone is 347-491-2955 (though Artifacts also show 929-305-7353); it reports GPA 3.8 and expected graduation May 2024 but the profile shows GPA 3.78, graduation Jun 2024, and honors (Dean's List, National Honor Society); and it misstates the internship as '02/2024–Current' and restoration of 400+ devices while the profile documents IT Support Intern 02/2024–05/2024 with ~800 devices refurbished/tracked and 100+ white-glove support tickets.
Tone: Professionalism 5, Action-Oriented 5, Persona Alignment 4 (average 4.7). Strengths: clear, formal tone and good grammar across the Professional Summary and sections; strong action verbs and quantified outcomes (e.g., restored over 400 devices, 96% cohort graduation rate, 65,000+ records) and concrete project details; skills and certifications align with an entry-level IT/software persona. Shortcomings: minor wording/format issues (""Honor's Society"" typo), a slightly over-broad/uneven skills/tools list (e.g., mixed tool naming like ""Apex Oracle SQL""), and the resume could be more tailored to a specific target role. No two category scores differ by more than one, indicating consistency.
Alignment: The resume partially matches the job: responsibilities matched ~4/7 (claims requirements elicitation and user-story writing in the summary, SDLC/Agile experience in skills, production support troubleshooting and device restoration, and instructional/mentoring experience) but lacks explicit evidence of key BA duties such as JAD/interview/shadowing examples, documented User Stories with Acceptance Criteria in work history, interface/source-to-target mapping, and build-vs-buy cost/benefit analysis. Tools/technologies match is low (matches SQL and web-application/database experience and Oracle SQL; missing Atlassian JIRA, explicit API/vendor integration experience), giving roughly 2 of 5 tool items. Outcomes/metrics are present but not BA-specific (measurable items include “restored over 400 devices” and a 96% cohort graduation rate), so limited alignment with required KPIs. Resume reads somewhat generic and not tailored to the listed company/title specifics (missing role-specific artifacts like JIRA tickets, integration mappings, explicit User Stories in projects), so a 2-point penalty is applied. Overall weighted score rounds to 2.
Impact: Contains multiple clear, measurable accomplishments (restored 400+ devices, taught 36 lessons to 200+ learners, 96% cohort graduation rate, generated reports from 65,000+ records), which aligns well with the requirement for explicit action-oriented, quantifiable outcomes. Points deducted for some passive/soft wording (e.g., “participate,” “assist”) and a few metrics that lack explicit business impact or context (the 65k-record report and device restorations aren’t tied to KPIs), per the rubric’s emphasis on active, business-tied metrics.
CredTail: Supports: Bachelor of Technology at NYC College of Technology (degree and institution present), IT Instructor Assistant at RF CUNY/Generation USA with matching dates (Feb 2022–Aug 2023), certifications (AWS, Google) match, and contact/LinkedIn/email are present in the artifacts. Partial support: Python, SQL, AWS, Git and database skills are present in the retrieval context; Java and .NET appear only in the artifacts text. Shortcomings (points deducted): Mayor’s Office employment is listed as 02/2024–Current in the Actual Output but the retrieval context shows Feb 2024–May 2024 (contradiction); bachelor graduation month and GPA differ (Actual: Expected May 2024, GPA 3.8 vs retrieval Jun 2024, GPA 3.78); two projects (Financial Stocks Report, EzRental POS) are not in the retrieval context (missing/fabricated); multiple listed technologies/tools (JavaScript, HTML, XML, Dart, C#, PHP, NetBeans, Visual Studio, Apex Oracle SQL) do not appear in the retrieval core_skills (missing). Given multiple missing/contradicted dates and several fabricated/absent projects and technologies, the output is only partially supported by the retrieval context.",210,2025-12-18 19:56:41.884884,8,6
127,1303,P2,8.75,8,7,35.75,"Punctuality: The score is 0.88 because the actual output contains a conflicting phone number (it lists 929-305-7353 while the structured profile shows the primary phone is 347-491-2955), it misstates the Mayor’s Office IT Support Intern role as 'Current' when the retrieval context dates it Feb 2024–May 2024, and it understates device refurbishment (~400) versus the profile's 800+ devices; other responsibilities (ServiceNow, Active Directory, Python automation, VIP support) are correctly reflected.
Tone: Professionalism: Clear, formal, and well-structured with good grammar and consistent bulleting; minor inconsistencies (e.g., “ServiceDesk” vs “ServiceNow”) and some generic soft-skill phrasing reduce polish. Action-Oriented: Uses strong verbs and includes measurable results (restored 400+ devices; 36 lessons; 96% graduation), but several bullets remain task-focused rather than impact- or metric-driven. Persona Alignment: Tone, vocabulary, tools, and certifications align well with an entry-level IT/ops persona, though depth/detail (versions, measurable project outcomes) is limited. No category is more than one point below the others, so no major imbalance flagged.
Alignment: Resume explicitly matches core intern requirements such as Windows 10/Active Directory support, helpdesk/endpoint hardware support, MS Office, NYC location, and strong GPA (11 explicit matches) and implies patch/imaging/server experience (5 implied) out of 23 total requirements (~59% match). Strengths: measurable outcomes (restored 400 devices, 96% cohort grad), explicit Active Directory/ServiceDesk use and customer-service focus (+bonus). Shortcomings: missing Office 365/SharePoint, Azure, enterprise endpoint protection, specific Windows Server versions, inventory and background-check/drug-test/legal-eligibility mentions. Converted match maps to a mid-range rating with the measurable outcomes/tool mentions improving the final score.
Impact: Strong use of measurable accomplishments (restored over 400 devices, taught 36 lessons to 200+ learners, 96% cohort graduation rate) and clear actions (taught, planned and led, deployed scripts), meeting the multiple-metrics criterion for a high base score. Minor weaknesses: several bullets use softer/passive phrasing (""Provide support,"" ""Assist,"" ""Participate"") that reduce perceived ownership. Business impact is present and attributable (graduation rate, large device restoration), so net adjustments favor a high score.
CredTail: Verified: name, email, LinkedIn, GitHub, Bachelor degree (Computer Information Systems, CUNY NYC College of Technology, GPA 3.78, Jun 2024) and the IT Instructor Assistant role/dates/highlights (Feb 2022–Aug 2023, 36 lessons, 96% grad rate) all match the Retrieval Context or its artifacts. Partial/mismatches: Mayor’s Office employer is present but title, dates and details diverge (Actual lists “Volunteer IT Support and Development Intern” and “Feb 2024 – Current” vs Retrieval “IT Support Intern” and “Feb 2024 – May 2024”); tooling lists ServiceDesk (Actual) vs ServiceNow (Retrieval) — partial mismatch. Fabricated/incorrect: device counts (Actual “400+” vs Retrieval “800+”) and the ongoing end date claim appear fabricated relative to the retrieval. Missing critical items: the Retrieval’s MS (expected Jan 2026), AWS and other advanced core technologies/certifications (AWS certs, Solutions Architect/AI Practitioner), and the major project (Alfred) are omitted. Because several critical fields are missing and there are fabricated/contradictory details for a current employer, credibility is substantially reduced; score reflects multiple major mismatches and omissions.",224,2025-12-18 19:57:08.157116,9,3

Tone: Professionalism rated 5: resume is consistently formal, well-structured, and error-free with clear headings and contact info. Action-Oriented rated 5: uses strong action verbs and measurable achievements (e.g., automated a sentiment pipeline for 1M+ records, 5× faster feedback loops, ~5% accuracy gain and ~8% toxicity reduction, 60% faster application time). Persona Alignment rated 5: tone and content match a solutions-focused AWS/ML engineer/intern persona (AWS/Glue/SageMaker/Bedrock work, FastAPI + GPT-4 Mini project, relevant certifications). Average = 5.0 (all categories equal; no notable weaknesses).
Alignment: Step 1 extracted required items: local to NYC + onsite 3 days/wk (lower Manhattan), Python, SQL, PL/SQL, PySpark, RDBMS concepts & data modeling, performant SQL across dialects, efficient/reusable ETL pipelines, Big Data/Data Warehousing experience, and willingness for a 12-month contract. Step 2 comparisons: Python, SQL, PL/SQL, and PySpark — direct matches (listed in Core Skills). RDBMS concepts and data modeling — direct match (Database Management). Multiple SQL dialects (PostgreSQL, Oracle, MySQL) — close paraphrase (databases named, but no explicit “performant SQL” claim). ETL pipelines with AWS Glue and SSIS — direct match. Big Data/large-scale processing — close paraphrase (Glue/Athena and a pipeline processing 1M+ records indicate scale but no explicit “data warehouse” term). Local/New York location — partial/close paraphrase (Location: New York, NY is present but no explicit onsite/tri-state availability or lower Manhattan 3-days/week commitment). 12-month contract willingness — missing. Role/title tailoring — weak: resume shows related internships and solutions-architect work but not a Data Engineer title or long-term contract data-engineering engagements. Step 3 specificity: resume includes strong named tools (AWS stack, Glue, Athena, QuickSight), quantified outcomes (1M+ records, 5× faster feedback loops, % improvements), and a concrete project (Alfred). Penalties: no explicit onsite/contract commitment and limited full-time Data Engineer experience. Combining match rate (most technical skills and tools matched), good specificity, and the noted missing items, the appropriate score reflects strong technical fit but lacking explicit onsite/contract confirmation and senior Data Engineer role experience.
Impact: The output includes multiple strong bullets with clear action verbs and specific metrics tied to business impact (e.g., automated pipeline processing 1M+ records, 5× faster feedback loops; fine-tuned models improving accuracy ~5% and reducing toxicity ~8%; delivered 36 lessons to 200+ learners with a 96% graduation rate; project reduced time-to-apply by 60%). These demonstrate measurable outcomes across efficiency, model performance, and customer outcomes. Shortcomings: several bullets remain vague or lack metrics (e.g., designing/presenting architectures, API integration, vendor management, IT support items) and a few use passive/ambiguous phrasing (“Managed relations,” “Supported VIP users”), which reduces clarity and should slightly penalize the rating.
CredTail: Step 1: Education claims (Master of Science expected Jan 2026; B.Tech Jun 2024 with GPAs and honors) are VERIFIED against the Retrieval Context (2/2). Experience claims (Solutions Architect Intern at AWS Jun–Sep 2025; Software Developer Jun–Sep 2024; IT Support Feb–May 2024; IT Instructor Assistant Feb 2022–Aug 2023) are VERIFIED (4/4). Core Skills: the majority of listed skills are VERIFIED (Python + libs, SQL/NoSQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle, MySQL, DynamoDB, AWS services including EC2/S3/Lambda/RDS/Glue/QuickSight, Glue/SSIS ETL, QuickSight/Power BI, Agile/SDLC/Git). Missing items (marked as fabrications/missing) are PL/SQL and PySpark which do not appear in the Retrieval Context. Per the instructions a strong penalty was applied to the Core Skills subscore for those missing claims. Aggregate credibility is high because Education and Experience are fully verified; the rating was primarily reduced due to the two missing core-skill items listed above.",218,2025-12-18 19:59:38.17926,9,9

Tone: The resume scores at the top across the three evaluation dimensions. Professionalism is excellent (polished tone, correct grammar, clear structure). Action-oriented language is strong with multiple quantified impacts (processed over 1M records, 5× faster feedback loops, 5% accuracy improvement, 8% reduction in hallucinations/toxicity, 60% time savings, 300% increase in applications). Persona alignment is highly appropriate for a Solutions Architect/Data Science/Generative AI role (extensive AWS/Bedrock/SageMaker experience, RAG, CI/CD, cloud and security skills). Category ratings are consistent with no notable discrepancies or weaknesses.
Alignment: High alignment across all evaluation steps: Responsibilities matched—resume demonstrates AWS data-engineering duties (designed scalable AWS architectures, built automated ETL/data pipelines, used Glue/Athena/SQL/Lambda, data analytics and governance), fulfilling the core AWS Data Engineer expectations (assigned full credit). Tools/technologies matched—multiple AWS services and platform tools from the job scope are explicitly listed (Glue, Athena, Lambda, S3, QuickSight, SageMaker, Bedrock, etc.), warranting full tool-match credit. Outcomes/metrics matched—clear measurable results are provided (processed >1M records, 5× faster feedback loops, 5% accuracy gain and 8% toxicity reduction from fine-tuning, project KPIs like 60% time savings), earning full outcome credit. No generic-resume penalty applied because the content is role-specific and tailored to AWS data engineering. Final weighted sum yields the maximum score.
Impact: The resume contains multiple explicit, action-oriented accomplishments with clear metrics (processed over 1M records; enabled 5× faster feedback-to-action; 5% accuracy increase and 8% reduction in toxicity; 60% time reduction and 300% increase in completed applications; 96% cohort graduation rate), which aligns well with the requirement for measurable outcomes and business impact. Strengths are specific numeric results and active phrasing for most bullets. Shortcomings: several metrics lack baseline/context or direct business KPIs (e.g., revenue or cost impact), and there are a few mildly passive descriptions, so a small penalty under the rubric for context and occasional vagueness.
CredTail: The resume's core factual claims are largely supported by the retrieval context: both degrees (CUNY SPS MS Data Science & Machine Learning, GPA 4.0, Expected Jan 2026; CUNY NYC College of Technology B.Tech, GPA 3.78, Jun 2024 with Dean’s List/National Honor Society), all listed internships with dates (AWS Solutions Architect Intern Jun 2025–Sep 2025; WOPLLI Jun 2024–Sep 2024; Mayor’s Office Feb 2024–May 2024; RF CUNY Feb 2022–Aug 2023), certifications (AWS Solutions Architect – Associate; AWS Certified AI Practitioner – Generative AI; Google Cybersecurity Certificate), and detailed AWS/ML technologies and project claims (EC2,S3,Lambda,RDS,DynamoDB,Glue,QuickSight,Bedrock,Macie,SageMaker; Python/pandas/scikit-learn/PyTorch; PostgreSQL+pgvector; RAG; the 1M+ records/5× faster and ~5%/8% SageMaker improvements) all appear in the retrieval context. There are only minor issues: “Tableau” is listed under Visualization in the Actual Output but does not appear in the retrieval context (unsupported/fabricated), and one certification present in the context (“Google Information Support Certificate”) is omitted in the Actual Output (minor omission). Because all major degrees, employers, dates, and nearly all listed technologies are supported and only a single technology is unsupported, a small deduction was applied.",215,2025-12-18 19:59:42.079417,9,8

Tone: Professionalism 4/5: clean, mostly formal resume with good grammar and clear sections (GPA 3.8, Dean’s List), but minor errors and inconsistent formatting (""Honor's Society"" apostrophe, ""GPA: 3.8 || Expected Graduation"", mixed tense in bullets). Action-Oriented 3/5: uses action verbs (Developed, Participated, Achieved) and includes measurable outcomes (65,000+ records, restoring 400+ devices, 96% graduation rate) but many bullets are generic/supportive rather than result-focused or quantified. Persona Alignment 4/5: strong alignment with an entry-level IT/software persona—relevant tech stack (.NET, MySQL, AWS), projects (Financial Stocks Report, POS app), and internship experience—though some skill-list redundancy and formatting reduce polish. Average mapped to a 0–10 scale gives the final score; Action-Oriented is flagged as ≥1 point lower than the highest category, indicating imbalance.
Alignment: I computed a ~32% match (5.5/17): explicit matches = SQL Server, AWS, GIT, SDLC/Agile; implied matches = Bachelor (in progress), mentoring/training experience, web-app projects. Major job requirements missing: Go, Angular, MongoDB, API design, Priority‑1 production troubleshooting, JIRA, microservices, WCAG accessibility, unit-test/automation experience, and 10+ years’ senior experience. This low coverage falls in the 25–49% band; after a -1 penalty for generic/non-tailored resume and +1 for explicit use of several required tools, the final calibrated score is 3.
Impact: Multiple clear action verbs and measurable outcomes support a high rating: GPA 3.8, generated reports from 65,000+ records, restored over 400 devices, taught 36 lessons to 200+ learners, and achieved a 96% cohort graduation rate. Some bullets use vague/supportive language (e.g., “Provide support,” “Assist in providing white glove service”) which reduces explicit ownership and clarity, so a small penalty was applied, but explicit accomplishments and business-impacting metrics justify a strong final score.
CredTail: Verified contact fields (email darwhin88@gmail.com, LinkedIn URL, location New York City, phone 929-305-7353 appears in the Retrieval Artifacts). Education: bachelor degree title matches but is a partial match — GPA (3.8 vs 3.78) and graduation timing/institution naming differ (Expected May 2024 / Brooklyn NY vs Jun 2024 / NYC College of Technology). Master’s degree present in the Retrieval Context (expected Jan 2026) is missing from the Actual Output. Experience: IT Instructor Assistant (Feb 2022–Aug 2023) is accurately represented; Mayor’s Office role has a partial match on employer and start date (Feb 2024) but the Actual Output’s “Current” end date and “restored over 400 devices” conflict with the Retrieval Context (Feb 2024–May 2024 and ~800 devices) — treated as a substantive mismatch/fabrication. Major internships listed in the Retrieval Context (AWS Solutions Architect Jun–Sep 2025, WOPLLI Jun–Sep 2024) and the key project (Alfred — FastAPI/Postgres/OpenAI) are missing from the Actual Output. Core technologies are partially matched (Python, SQL, .NET, AWS presence) but many specific skills/services (SageMaker, Glue, Bedrock, FastAPI, Docker, PostgreSQL/pgvector, CI/CD, ML/tooling) are omitted. Given multiple missing critical fields and at least one fabricated/inconsistent claim, the credibility is low and the score reflects major mismatches and omissions.",229,2025-12-18 20:00:17.256156,9,3
131,1008,P4,8,10,3,31,"Punctuality: The score is 0.80 because the actual output contains several mismatches with the retrieval context: the phone number differs (structured profile 347-491-2955 vs Artifacts 929-305-7353); the Bachelor GPA is recorded as 3.78 in the structured profile but an Artifact lists 3.8; the Bachelor's completion date is Jun 2024 in the structured profile versus Expected Graduation: May 2024 in Artifacts; the role and dates conflict (structured: IT Support Intern Feb 2024–May 2024, whereas an Artifact lists a Volunteer role Feb 2024–Current); the device claim is inconsistent (structured profile documents refurbishing/tracking 800+ devices, not restoring 400+); and the title is inconsistent (document notes white glove support but the structured role is IT Support Intern, not Volunteer IT Support and Development Intern).
Tone: Professionalism scored at the top end due to a clear, well-formatted resume with correct grammar, consistent headings, and concise summary and sections. Action-Oriented scored at the top end because the content uses strong action verbs and multiple quantified accomplishments (restored 400+ devices, automated troubleshooting reducing manual workload by 30%, 96% graduation rate, reports from 65,000+ records). Persona Alignment scored at the top end as the skills and experience (SDLC, requirements documentation, integration mappings, mentorship) align closely with a technologist/Business Systems Analyst role. The three component scores are consistent with no notable gaps, producing the highest average which is mapped to the 0–10 scale.
Alignment: Direct matches: Requirements elicitation/User Stories with Acceptance Criteria (critical) — present; SDLC across Agile/Waterfall/Hybrid (critical) — present; Systems analysis/design (critical) — present; Integration/source→target mappings (critical) — present; Mentorship/problem solving (optional/critical) — present. Missing or weak vs. JD: explicit JAD facilitation and UAT leadership (critical) not shown; build vs. buy / cost‑benefit analysis (business strategy) absent; SQL querying and Atlassian JIRA (must‑have tools) not listed; vendor API experience not demonstrated. Measurable outcomes are present and reasonably concrete (restored 400+ devices, 30% reduction in manual work, 96% graduation rate, 65k+ record report), which strengthens impact scoring. Major shortcomings: lack of on‑site/Geographic tailoring (resume lists NYC vs JD Mechanicsville VA and no hybrid/onsite confirmation) and some generic phrasing. Balancing responsibility matches (good), weak tool matches (poor), and solid metrics (good) with a penalty for generic/lack of tailoring yields a mid‑low alignment score.
Impact: Multiple bullets clearly combine an action verb, a measurable result, and a business outcome — e.g., “Restored 400+ devices…enhancing operational efficiency,” “Automated troubleshooting…reducing manual workload by 30%,” “Delivered 36 lessons to 200+ learners…96% graduation rate,” and “Developed a web application generating reports from 65,000+ records…improving user experience.” Metrics are precise (counts and percentages), meeting the metric-quality criterion. Minor vague wording (e.g., “white glove service,” “proven track record”) lacks quantified impact and warrants a small penalty, but overall the output strongly satisfies the evaluation steps.
CredTail: Score set to reflect multiple high-priority inconsistencies vs the Retrieval Context. Exact matches: Bachelor of Technology (Computer/Information Systems) at NYC College of Technology; IT Instructor Assistant at RF CUNY & Generation USA with matching dates (Feb 2022–Aug 2023); email and LinkedIn URL match. Partial matches: Mayor’s Office employer is present in both sources but differs in title/details. Missing fields (penalized): Master of Science (CUNY SPS) present in Retrieval but omitted from Actual Output; two internships from Retrieval (AWS Solutions Architect Intern (Jun–Sep 2025) and Software Developer Intern at WOPLLI (Jun–Sep 2024)) are absent from Actual Output. Core technologies/skills present in Retrieval but not listed in Actual Output (high-priority omissions): Python, AWS (EC2/S3/Lambda/Glue/SageMaker/Bedrock), SQL/NoSQL, Docker, CI/CD, FastAPI/postgres/pgvector, and generative-AI tooling. Suspected fabrications / direct contradictions (heavily penalized): Mayor’s Office dates (Actual shows “Feb 2024 – Current” vs Retrieval “Feb 2024 – May 2024”) and conflicting device counts (Actual 400+ vs Retrieval 800+). Dates discrepancy for the bachelor’s graduation (Actual May 2024 vs Retrieval Jun 2024) also noted. Given missing high-priority degrees/employers, omitted core technologies, and a direct employment/date contradiction, the deductions exceed allowable credibility, so the final credibility assessment is the lowest possible and verification is recommended for all penalized items (education records, internship employment dates, and technical skill claims).",211,2025-12-18 20:00:20.955503,10,0

Tone: Professionalism = 5: consistently formal, error-free tone with industry-appropriate terminology (Active Directory, ServiceNow, Windows Server) and clear formatting. Action-Oriented = 5: strong action verbs and quantified outcomes throughout (automated troubleshooting with Python, refurbished/tracked 800+ devices, supported 100+ white-glove tickets, 96% cohort graduation rate, 60% reduction in time-to-apply). Persona Alignment = 5: tone, experience level, certifications, and project details align well with an entry-level/early-career IT support/systems role. Average = 5.0/5 (all categories equal; highest and lowest are the same), indicating excellent alignment with the evaluation steps and no significant shortcomings noted.
Alignment: Followed evaluation steps: extracted required items and compared to resume. Direct matches: Windows 10 and Windows Server 2012/2016/2019, Active Directory, helpdesk support/troubleshooting, inventory/refurbishment of devices (800 devices), customer service, ServiceNow and CrowdStrike (named tools), New York location, current student with GPA 3.78. Close/paraphrase matches: evidence of applying IT best practices (intern tasks), endpoint protection (cybersecurity training), multitasking/teamwork, VPN/VOIP support. Missing or not mentioned: patch management systems, endpoint imaging systems, explicit Microsoft Office 365/SharePoint administration, Microsoft Azure, and explicit agreement to background check/drug test. Specificity is strong (quantified device counts, ticket numbers, cohort metrics) which raises credit; penalties for several omitted role-specific tools/features that the job listed. Overall high match rate with several notable omissions, so score reflects strong alignment but not perfect fit.
Impact: Strong use of action verbs with multiple clear, specific metrics tied to business impact: refurbished/tracked 800+ devices, handled 100+ white-glove tickets, delivered 36 lessons to 200+ learners, achieved a 96% cohort graduation rate, and reduced time-to-apply by 60%. These metrics show operational efficiency, customer outcomes, and training impact. Minor shortcomings: several bullets lack measurable results or use vague phrasing (e.g., “automated troubleshooting workflows” without a quantified reduction, “supported VIP users,” and “participated in cybersecurity training”), so small deductions for occasional passive/ambiguous language.
CredTail: Education claims fully VERIFIED: Bachelor of Technology (CUNY NYC College of Technology), Jun 2024 graduation, GPA 3.78, Dean’s List (5x), National Honor Society all appear in the Retrieval Context.

134,472,P3,9.761904761904761,10,9,44.76190476190476,"Punctuality: The score is 0.98 because the actual output mostly matches the retrieval context (noting experience with Python, SQL and ETL/ELT tools like AWS Glue and SSIS) but has two small inaccuracies from the contradictions: it labels Darwhin as a ""solutions-focused Data Engineer"" instead of the retrieval context's ""solutions-focused technologist,"" and it mentions PL/SQL even though PL/SQL is not listed in the retrieval context.
Tone: Professionalism: 5 — resume is formally worded, well-structured, and grammatically clean with clear headings (PROFESSIONAL SUMMARY, EDUCATION, SKILLS, EXPERIENCE). Action-Oriented: 5 — uses strong verbs and quantified impact throughout (e.g., processed 1M+ records, 5× faster feedback loops, ~5% accuracy gain, ~8% toxicity reduction, 96% graduation rate, 60% reduction in application time). Persona Alignment: 5 — voice, skills (Python, SQL, ETL, AWS), projects, and certifications align well with a data-engineer/solutions-architect persona at an entry-to-mid level. Average = 5.0; no two category scores differ by more than 1, so no inconsistency noted.
Alignment: Strong alignment with the job requirements: the resume explicitly demonstrates core responsibilities (Python, SQL, PL/SQL, PySpark, ETL pipeline development, RDBMS concepts and data modeling) — only onsite 3-days/week availability is not explicitly stated. Tools/technologies match is high (Python, PySpark, PostgreSQL/Oracle/MySQL, AWS Glue, SSIS, etc.). Measurable outcomes are present and relevant (e.g., sentiment pipeline processing 1M+ records, 5× faster feedback loops; 60% reduction in application time; model accuracy improvements), supporting outcome/KPI matches. The profile is tailored (summary names Innovim) so no generic- resume penalty applied. Based on weighted evaluation and no penalty, the final rounded score is nine.
Impact: The resume contains multiple explicit, action-oriented statements with clear metrics and outcomes (e.g., automated sentiment-analysis pipeline processing 1M+ records with 5× faster feedback loops; SageMaker tuning improving accuracy ~5% and reducing toxicity ~8%; project reducing application time by 60%; 96% cohort graduation; >100 tickets handled). These are specific, measurable results tied to operational/business impact, which warrants a high rating. Shortcomings: some passive or vague language in the professional summary (""Committed,"" ""Proven track record,"" ""Eager to contribute"") and a few items lack context or clear ROI (""automated troubleshooting workflows"" without % reduction, ""white glove support on over 100 tickets"" without impact), so it is not top-tier metric clarity. Overall strong metric presence but penalized modestly for passive phrasing and occasional missing context.

Data Science & ML expected Jan 2026 with GPA 4.0, and B.Tech CIS Jun 2024 with GPA 3.78 and honors) appear in the Retrieval Context; all four employers and their dates (AWS Solutions Architect Intern Jun 2025–Sep 2025, WOPLLI Jun 2024–Sep 2024, Mayor’s Office IT Support Feb 2024–May 2024, RF CUNY & Generation USA IT Instructor Assistant Feb 2022–Aug 2023) match exactly; certifications and many core technologies (PostgreSQL, Oracle, MySQL, MongoDB, DynamoDB, AWS Glue, SSIS, QuickSight, Power BI, SIEM, Active Directory, Linux, SageMaker, etc.) are present. Deductions for missing/fabricated items: PL/SQL does not appear in the Retrieval Context, PySpark is not listed (retrieval lists PyTorch instead), and the project’s LLM name differs (Actual says “GPT-4 Mini” while Retrieval lists “OpenAI GPT-4.1 mini”). Phone number in the resume is present in the Artifacts section but differs from the structured profile phone.

Tone: High professionalism: well-structured, clear headings, consistent formatting and grammar. Strong action-orientation: multiple action verbs and quantified outcomes (e.g., 1M+ records, 5x faster, 5% accuracy gain, 8% toxicity reduction, 60% time reduction, 300% matching improvement). Excellent persona alignment: content and technical skills (AWS, SageMaker, cloud architecture, generative AI) directly match a solutions-architect/data-science role. Scores are consistent (no notable gaps); only minor shortcomings are a few bullets without precise quantification or punctuation inconsistencies.
Alignment: Strong alignment on core responsibilities: the resume explicitly shows designing AWS architectures and building automated data pipelines (critical items) and includes pipeline/ML work (optional). Tools match is high — multiple exact AWS services listed (EC2, S3, Lambda, RDS, DynamoDB, Glue, QuickSight, SageMaker) plus AWS certs. Outcomes are concrete and measurable (1M+ records, 5x faster feedback, 5% accuracy gain, 8% toxicity reduction, 60% time reduction, 96% cohort grad), which earns full credit for impact. Shortcomings: not tailored to Capgemini or New Jersey, no explicit “Data Engineer” job title, and some metrics/readability feel potentially inflated/generic, so points deducted for lack of company/title-specific tailoring and slight generic language.
Impact: Multiple bullets include clear action verbs + measurable results + business outcomes (e.g., built sentiment pipeline processing 1M+ records with 5x faster feedback; fine-tuned models improving accuracy 5% and reducing toxicity 8%; delivered 36 lessons to 200+ learners with a 96% graduation rate; FastAPI cut application time by 60%; PostgreSQL improved job-matching accuracy by 300%), satisfying the highest tier of the first step. Metric quality is strong (precise counts, percentages, and multipliers), so full additional points apply. Minor vagueness appears in a few items (e.g., “reducing manual workload significantly,” “enhancing scalability and security” without numeric impact), so a small penalty was applied. Overall the output demonstrates high clarity, measurable impact, and business relevance.

Tone: Resume demonstrates top-tier professionalism (clean formatting, consistent tone, no grammar issues) and is highly action-oriented with strong verbs and clear outcomes—e.g., automated a pipeline processing 1M+ records, improved model accuracy and reduced toxicity, and maintained a 96% cohort graduation rate. Persona alignment is excellent for cloud/data-science and solutions-architect roles, with deep AWS/SageMaker/Bedrock experience and a relevant RAG/GPT project; only minor off-target element is an additional cybersecurity certificate that’s less central to the stated data/cloud focus. There are no significant imbalances across the evaluated categories.
Alignment: Resume explicitly satisfies many core ML/cloud requirements (PyTorch/scikit-learn, SageMaker, Bedrock LLMs, RAG, CI/CD) and measurable outcomes (1M+ record pipeline, accuracy/toxicity improvements), covering 8 of 17 items with 6 additional implied (~65% match). Key shortcomings vs the Meta posting: no 8+ years of senior programming experience, no explicit UI implementation, limited evidence of org-level leadership/major-initiative ownership, and no explicit algorithms/graph-theory expertise. Measurable results and explicit tool use earned a bonus; final score reflects solid technical fit but missing senior-level and some role-specific responsibilities.
Impact: Strong alignment with Step 1: multiple action verbs and concrete metrics (processed 1M+ records; ~5% accuracy improvement; ~8% toxicity reduction; 96% cohort graduation rate; 36 lessons for 200+ learners; 4.0 and 3.78 GPAs, Dean’s List). Clear ownership language (designed, built, automated, fine-tuned) meets Step 3 requirements with only minor vagueness in some bullets (e.g., Virtual Credential System, Azure config) that lack measurable outcomes. Business impact is explicit for several items (real-time QuickSight dashboards, reduced manual workload), supporting a positive Step 4 adjustment. Overall strong but not perfect quantification across every bullet, so scored near the top.
CredTail: Most critical fields align with the Retrieval Context: both degrees (M.S. Data Science & ML, expected Jan 2026, GPA 4.0; B.Tech Computer Information Systems, Jun 2024, GPA 3.78, Dean’s List 5x, National Honor Society) are present and match; employers and dates for AWS (Solutions Architect Intern, Jun 2025–Sep 2025), WOPLLI (Jun 2024–Sep 2024), Mayor’s Office (Feb 2024–May 2024), and RF CUNY/Generation USA (Feb 2022–Aug 2023) match exactly; core technologies (Python, AWS services including Glue/QuickSight/SageMaker, FastAPI, PostgreSQL/pgvector, OpenAI/GPT, Docker, CI/CD) are represented consistently. No fabricated items detected. Minor omissions/variances: the Master’s Dean’s List 2x noted in the Retrieval Context is not shown in the Actual Output, one certification from the context (Google Information Support Certificate) is omitted, and there are small naming differences in project LLM labels (e.g., “GPT-4.1 mini” vs “GPT-4.1”).

Tone: Professionalism (5): consistent, formal, error-free formatting and industry-appropriate language (clear headers, contact info, GPA, certifications). Action-Oriented (5): frequent strong action verbs and quantified results (automated sentiment pipeline processing 1M+ records with 5x improvement; Alfred project reduced application time by 60% and increased applications by 300%; 96% cohort graduation rate). Persona Alignment (5): tone, skills (AWS, FastAPI, microservices), certifications, and internship/project focus align well with an early-career solutions architect/technologist. Average on the 1–5 scale is 5; all three sub-scores are equal (highest=lowest=5), indicating consistently strong performance across the evaluated aspects.
Alignment: Strengths: resume directly matches many required technologies and responsibilities—Bachelor’s degree; Go, Angular, MongoDB, SQL Server; AWS experience and certifications; designing/creating APIs; microservices; Agile/SDLC; Git; claims of developing scalable web apps. It also provides quantified results (1M+ records pipeline, 5x feedback improvement; 60% time reduction, 300% application increase), which supports specificity. Close/paraphrased: mentoring (instructor assistant + “mentoring” skill) and automation/testing (Postman scripts, CI/CD/automated pipelines) but lacks explicit test-suite/regression automation and unit-testing emphasis. Missing/weak: the single biggest mismatch is the 10+ years senior experience requirement (candidate is early-career with internships), no mention of JIRA, no evidence of resolving Priority-1 production incidents, no accessibility/WCAG experience, and no explicit senior title or end-to-end project ownership at scale. Given a high technical tool-match and measurable outcomes but critical gaps on seniority, production incident handling, and some required tools, the overall fit is modest.
Impact: The resume contains multiple strong, quantifiable bullets tied to business impact (e.g., automated sentiment pipeline processing 1M+ records with a 5x faster feedback loop; Alfred project reducing application time by 60% and increasing weekly applications by 300%; delivered 36 lessons to 200+ learners and maintained a 96% graduation rate), which demonstrates clear action verbs plus specific metrics. However, several experience bullets lack measurable results or use vague phrasing (e.g., “Designed and presented secure, scalable AWS reference architectures,” “Automated troubleshooting workflows… improving operational efficiency”) leading to ambiguity and repeated passive/unclear language. Overall, the output shows strong measurable outcomes in key areas (efficiency, throughput, user outcomes) but is held back by inconsistent application of metrics across all bullets.

Missing/fabricated items: JavaScript, Go, HTML, CSS, Angular, Bootstrap (these are not in the structured profile or artifacts). I applied a strong penalty for these missing core-technology claims (proportional core subscore ~8 → penalized to 6). Education and Experience subscores are 10 each.

Tone: Professionalism: strong formal tone and error-free grammar across sections (clear summary, education, skills). Action-Oriented: consistently uses strong verbs and quantifies impact (automated workflows, refurbished 800+ devices, resolved 100+ tickets, 96% graduation rate, 60% time reduction, 300% increase in applications). Persona Alignment: tightly fits an entry-level IT support intern with relevant tools and certifications (Active Directory, ServiceNow, CrowdStrike, Azure, Google certificates). All three categories merit top marks (5/5 each), yielding an average of 5.0 and no category discrepancies >1, indicating consistent, well-aligned output.
Alignment: Step 1 (responsibilities): Resume demonstrates key responsibilities from the posting — Windows 10/Active Directory support, endpoint hardware/helpdesk support, inventory management (refurbished 800 devices), troubleshooting, and general endpoint management — but omits explicit patch management, SharePoint administration, and Windows Server 2012/2016/2019 experience. This yields a partial match (about 69%), contributing roughly 3.5/5. Step 2 (tools/technologies): Explicit matches include Windows 10, Active Directory, Microsoft Office/Office365, Microsoft Azure, and enterprise endpoint protection (CrowdStrike) — roughly 50% of listed tools, ~1.25/2.5. Step 3 (outcomes/metrics): Strong measurable results are present (800 devices refurbished, 100+ helpdesk tickets, 96% course graduation, project KPIs like 60% time reduction), giving a high match ~2.25/2.5. Penalty: resume is tailored (mentions ETech 7 in the summary and NYC location/GPA fits), so no penalty applied. Weighted total rounds to a final score of 7.
Impact: The output contains multiple explicit, action-oriented accomplishments with clear, quantifiable outcomes—e.g., refurbished over 800 devices for redeployment, delivered 100+ helpdesk tickets, taught 36 lessons to 200+ learners with a 96% graduation rate, and the Alfred project which cut application time by 60% and increased weekly applications by 300%—all of which demonstrate measurable business impact and use active language. Shortcomings: a few items are vague or lack metrics (e.g., “high customer satisfaction ratings,” “enhancing efficiency” from automated workflows, and some “white glove” support claims), which warrants a modest penalty under the rubric for non-specific or partially passive descriptions. Overall strong metric clarity and business relevance, but not perfectly consistent across every bullet.

Missing or fabricated items caused deductions: the résumé’s reference to ETech 7 does not appear in the retrieval context (fabricated); Windows 10, Microsoft Office 365, and the exact phrase “Endpoint Management” are not present in the retrieval context (missing); the project claims “OpenAI GPT-4” while the retrieval context specifies “OpenAI GPT-4.1 mini” (mismatch); “Cybersecurity” listed as an interest is not in the retrieval interests list (missing). Given comprehensive support for key degrees, employers, dates, certifications and many technologies but several specific omissions/fabrications, the output warrants a score reflecting minor-to-moderate deviations from the retrieval context.",225,2025-12-18 20:07:25.979379,8,7
139,472,P4,8.96551724137931,9,9,36.96551724137931,"Punctuality: The score is 0.90 because the actual output mislabels the Mayor’s Office position as a 'Volunteer IT Support and Development Intern' and marks it as 'Current' instead of the context's 'IT Support Intern' dated Feb 2024–May 2024, underreports device work as 400+ rather than the context's 800+, and gives an expected graduation of May 2024 while the retrieval context lists the degree date as Jun 2024.
Tone: Professionalism: clear, well-structured, and mostly professional with correct grammar and concise sections, but minor formatting inconsistencies (all-caps header, uppercase email, LinkedIn formatted as a bracketed link) slightly reduce polish. Action-oriented: very strong — uses active verbs and multiple quantified impacts (e.g., automated pipeline processing 1M+ records, 5× faster feedback loops; SageMaker improvements; 96% cohort graduation; 60% reduction in application time), demonstrating measurable accomplishments. Persona alignment: excellent fit for solutions-architect/data-engineering roles — relevant skills (Python, PySpark, SQL, AWS), projects, certifications, and metrics align closely with the target role. Overall, strengths are clear impact metrics and role relevance; primary shortcoming is small formatting/header polish.
Alignment: Strong alignment: critical responsibilities—Python, SQL, PL/SQL, PySpark, ETL pipeline development, RDBMS/data modeling—are explicitly present in Core Skills and Experience. Tools match: Python, SQL, PL/SQL, PySpark, PostgreSQL/Oracle/MySQL and AWS (Glue) are listed. Measurable outcomes are provided (1M+ records, 5× faster pipelines, 5% accuracy gain, 8% toxicity reduction, 96% graduation rate, 60% reduced application time), demonstrating concrete impact. Shortcomings: the resume does not explicitly state onsite NYC tri‑state availability or the 3 days/week lower Manhattan requirement, nor does it reference contract-duration tailoring; summary has some generic phrasing. Small deduction for lack of explicit onsite/contract details.
Impact: Multiple bullets include action verbs, precise metrics, and clear business outcomes (e.g., Automated sentiment-analysis pipeline processing 1M+ records enabling 5× faster feedback loops; Fine-tuned SageMaker models +5% accuracy/−8% toxicity; Delivered 36 lessons to 200+ learners with a 96% graduation rate; Project reduced application time by 60% and boosted applications 300%). Metric quality is high (specific counts and percentages). Minor shortfalls: a few items (generic pipeline improvement, automated troubleshooting) lack numeric impact, so there is a small vagueness penalty.
CredTail: Evidence-based comparison to the Retrieval Context: Exact matches — name, email, LinkedIn URL, AWS Solutions Architect Intern role and Jun 2025–Sep 2025 dates, IT Instructor Assistant role and Feb 2022–Aug 2023 dates, Alfred project outcomes, and listed certifications (AWS Solutions Architect – Associate, AWS AI Practitioner – Generative AI, Google Cybersecurity). Partial/contradictory matches — Mayor’s Office role appears in both sources but dates conflict (Retrieval Context: Feb 2024–May 2024; Actual Output: Feb 2024–Current) (counted as a direct contradiction per step 2). Missing items from Actual Output that are present in Retrieval Context — Master of Science (Data Science & ML) expected Jan 2026 (missing), Software Developer Intern at WOPLLI Technologies (Jun 2024–Sep 2024) (missing), and core technologies present in Retrieval Context but omitted from Actual Output (notably Bedrock, QuickSight, Docker) — each treated as high-priority technology discrepancies. Date discrepancy — Bachelor’s graduation listed as Expected May 2024 in Actual vs Jun 2024 in Retrieval Context. Deductions applied per evaluation steps: missing degree (−2), missing employer (−2), direct contradiction (−4), bachelor date mismatch (−2), three missing core technologies (−2 each). Recommend source verification for Mayor’s Office employment dates (possible fabrication/overstatement), confirmation of the Master’s enrollment/degree, WOPLLI internship, and inclusion/verification of omitted core technologies and exact graduation date to resolve penalized items.",221,2025-12-18 20:07:46.883149,10,0

Tone: Professionalism 4/5: clear formatting, consistent bullets, good grammar, and contact/education sections present; minor issues include all-caps name, a few clunky phrasings, and small consistency polish needed. Action-Oriented 5/5: strong use of action verbs and measurable outcomes (36 lessons, 200+ learners, 96% graduation rate, restored 400+ devices; project details like FastAPI + GPT-4 Mini). Persona Alignment 4/5: tone and skills align with a data/tech early-career role (Python, SQL, ML, Power BI, relevant certifications and project), but professional experience is heavier on IT/support and teaching than hands-on data-science roles. Both Professionalism and Persona Alignment are each 1 point lower than the highest category (Action-Oriented), indicating slight imbalance. Overall score reflects these strengths and minor shortcomings.
Alignment: The resume meets many core requirements: explicit technical skills (Python with pandas, SQL/NoSQL, QuickSight/Power BI), data collection/cleansing, database work (Google Sheets), and is actively pursuing an MS in Data Science; it also shows a measurable outcome (96% cohort graduation) and implementation experience (projects). Several internship responsibilities are only implied or missing—QA checks, formal reporting/presentation experience, and any financial-domain knowledge are absent—so overall match is about three-quarters of listed requirements; I applied a small penalty for lack of role/company tailoring and a small bonus for measurable outcomes and explicit tools.
Impact: High base due to multiple explicit action verbs and concrete metrics (e.g., “Delivered 36 lessons” to 200+ learners, “96% cohort graduation rate,” “restored over 400 devices,” 4.0 and 3.78 GPAs). Minor shortcomings: several generic, non‑quantified statements (e.g., “Good communication skills,” “Provide support…”) create slight vagueness and reduce perceived ownership in parts of the resume. Strong business impact and clear ownership on key accomplishments justify a positive adjustment to the final score.
CredTail: Degrees, education dates/honors, contact info, IT Instructor Assistant role (Feb 2022–Aug 2023), certifications, and the Alfred project are exact or close matches to the Retrieval Context. Partial matches: core skills include Python, SQL, QuickSight/Power BI and ML but omit many listed technologies (AWS services, Azure, PyTorch, Docker/CI-CD, PostgreSQL+pgvector, Bedrock/SageMaker, etc.). Missing: two major employers/roles present in the Retrieval Context (Solutions Architect Intern at AWS Jun 2025–Sep 2025 and Software Developer Intern at WOPLLI Jun 2024–Sep 2024) are absent from the Actual Output. Mismatches/fabrications: Mayor’s Office entry differs in title/dates (Actual says Feb 2024–Current vs Retrieval Feb 2024–May 2024) and device counts/details (400 vs 800), indicating at least one fabricated/altered detail. Given multiple missing critical employers, omitted core technologies, and the fabricated/mismatched Mayor’s Office details, the response receives a low credibility rating under the evaluation rules (substantial penalty for fabricated items and decrements for each missing critical field).",239,2025-12-18 20:08:05.643288,9,3
141,1177,P1,10,10,6,45,"Punctuality: The score is 1.00 because the Contradictions list is empty, indicating no discrepancies between the actual output and the retrieval context — well done!
Tone: Assigned ratings per the evaluation steps: Professionalism 5 (consistently formal, industry-appropriate formatting and no obvious errors), Action-Oriented 5 (frequent strong verbs and quantified results such as a pipeline processing over 1M feedback records, 5× faster feedback-to-action, and model improvements of 5% accuracy / 8% reduction in toxicity), Persona Alignment 5 (tone and content clearly match a Solutions Architect / data/ML early-career candidate with AWS skills: Bedrock, SageMaker, Glue, Lambda, QuickSight). Numeric average of the three ratings is 5.0 (highest=Professionalism/Action-Oriented/Persona Alignment all equal; no lowest), mapped to the 0–10 output scale yields the returned score.
Alignment: Strong technical alignment on ML and cloud: resume directly matches multiple required tools and responsibilities (PyTorch and scikit-learn listed; extensive AWS experience including SageMaker and Bedrock; built a RAG system with pgvector indicating IR/retrieval understanding; end-to-end project ownership with Alfred; quantified impact—1M-record sentiment pipeline, 5× faster turnaround, fine-tuning improvements of 5% accuracy and 8% reduction in hallucinations). Close/paraphrase matches: cross-functional work is implied by presenting to enterprise clients and tailoring architectures, and ownership/mentorship is partially shown via instructor role and project leadership. Key gaps vs Meta requirements: seniority and leadership level (no 8+ years or senior role evidence, limited evidence of setting direction/leading major org initiatives), missing explicit UI-building experience, limited explicit IR details (indexing/query/ranking) and limited algorithms/graph-theory claims, TensorFlow not shown. Overall the resume demonstrates strong ML engineering and measurable project impact but falls short on the senior leadership/experience and a few role-specific items, yielding a mid-range score.
Impact: Strong presence of action verbs with multiple specific metrics: built a sentiment pipeline processing >1M records enabling 5× faster feedback-to-action, fine-tuned models with a 5% accuracy gain and 8% reduction in toxicity, delivered 36 lessons to 200+ learners with a 96% graduation rate. These are relevant business/efficiency outcomes (throughput, accuracy, retention). Minor deductions because several bullets are vague or lack measurable results (e.g., “Designed and presented secure, scalable AWS architectures,” “Automated troubleshooting…reducing manual workload” and some passive phrasing like “Supported VIP users”), reducing clarity on impact and frequency. Overall high alignment with the evaluation steps.
CredTail: Step 1 labeling: Education claims VERIFIED (Master of Science — City Univ SPS, Expected Jan 2026, GPA 4.0; Bachelor of Technology — NYC College of Technology, Jun 2024, GPA 3.78, Dean’s List (5x), National Honor Society). Experience claims VERIFIED (4 roles: Solutions Architect Intern at AWS Jun 2025–Sep 2025; Software Developer Intern WOPLLI Jun 2024–Sep 2024; IT Support Intern Mayor’s Office Feb 2024–May 2024; IT Instructor Assistant RF CUNY & Generation USA Feb 2022–Aug 2023 — titles, companies, dates, and highlights match Retrieval Context). Core Skills/Projects VERIFIED (Python/pandas/scikit-learn/PyTorch, SQL, R, Java/JavaScript, AWS services including Bedrock/SageMaker/Glue/QuickSight, Azure, FastAPI, PostgreSQL+pgvector, OpenAI GPT-4.1 mini, Docker, CI/CD, RAG, Postman/Swagger). No items were contradicted or absent in the Retrieval Context; therefore no fabrications or missing items to list. Subscores computed from verified proportions: Education 10/10, Experience 10/10, Core Skills 10/10. Aggregate assessment: all key claims are corroborated by the Retrieval Context, yielding top-tier credibility driven by complete alignment across education, work history, certifications, projects, and technical skills.",233,2025-12-18 20:10:16.031271,9,10

Tone: Professionalism scored 5: resume uses a formal tone, clean formatting, and correct grammar throughout. Action-Oriented scored 5: bullets use strong verbs and multiple quantified impacts (e.g., processing 1M+ records, 5× faster feedback loops, ~5% accuracy improvement, 60% time reduction, 300% increase). Persona Alignment scored 3: technical skills and project detail match a software/solutions role, but the “over 10 years” claim conflicts with recent degree and internship dates, creating a seniority mismatch. Average = (5+5+3)/3 = 4.3 (scaled to 10 ≈ 8.7, rounded), and there is an inconsistency because two categories differ by more than 1 (5 vs 3).
Alignment: The resume matches several key requirements (mentions Go, Angular, MongoDB, AWS, Git, JIRA, microservices and API/SDLC experience) yielding strong tool alignment and some responsibility overlap (mentoring, Agile work, API/microservices design). It also provides measurable outcomes (1M+ records pipeline, 5× faster feedback, 60% time reduction and 300% application increase) supporting outcome alignment. Shortcomings: limited concrete senior-level ownership evidence (end-to-end project accountability, P1 production fault-finding, strong unit-testing, SQL Server/WCAG specifics) and an inconsistent experience claim (summary cites 10+ years while roles are internships/recent grads), so a 2-point penalty was applied. Combining weighted responsibility (partial match), tools (high match), and outcomes (moderate match) yields the final rounded score.
Impact: The output includes multiple explicit, action-oriented accomplishments with clear metrics and business impact (e.g., automated pipeline processing 1M+ records with 5× faster feedback loops; SageMaker model +~5% accuracy and −~8% toxicity; 96% cohort graduation for 200+ learners; Alfred: −60% time-to-apply and +300% weekly applications). These meet the evaluation steps for measurable results and tie to outcomes. A small number of items remain vague or unquantified (e.g., “reduced manual workload” and some vendor/architecture statements), so a minor penalty is applied for those omissions and occasional passive phrasing.
CredTail: Strong alignment for major items: both degrees (M.S. Data Science & Machine Learning, expected Jan 2026; B.Tech CIS, Jun 2024) exactly match the retrieval context, as do employers and dates for AWS (Solutions Architect Intern, Jun 2025–Sep 2025), WOPLLI (Jun 2024–Sep 2024), Mayor’s Office (Feb 2024–May 2024), and RF CUNY/Generation (Feb 2022–Aug 2023). Projects (Alfred), certifications, AWS services (SageMaker, QuickSight, Glue, Lambda, etc.), Docker, Git, PostgreSQL, MongoDB, ETL/ELT, and security items are all supported. Minor omissions/fabrications: Go and Angular (claimed in the summary/core skills) do not appear in the retrieval context; JIRA and front-end specifics (JavaScript/HTML/CSS) are not listed in the retrieval context either. Phone number used (929-305-7353) appears in the Artifacts but the structured profile contains a different number (347-491-2955), an inconsistency to note. Because core degrees, employers, dates, projects, and most technologies are fully supported but several claimed technologies are absent, the output is credible with minor omissions.",230,2025-12-18 20:10:52.866759,9,8

Tone: Professionalism 5/5 — clear, well-formatted and professional resume with correct grammar and logical sections (minor punctuation/formatting inconsistencies). Action-Oriented 5/5 — uses strong action verbs and quantifies impact (restored 400+ devices, handled 100+ tickets, taught 36 lessons to 200+ learners with a 96% graduation rate, built reports from 65k+ records). Persona Alignment 5/5 — tone, skills, projects, and certifications (AWS, Google Cybersecurity) strongly match an IT support/infrastructure persona. Scores are consistent (largest gap 0); computed average is 5.0.
Alignment: Responsibility match: Resume explicitly shows Active Directory, general Windows support, helpdesk/endpoint hardware support, troubleshooting and server-team support (critical items) but omits explicit Windows 10/AD admin tasks detail and several infrastructure responsibilities (counted partial match). Tools/technologies: Exact matches include Active Directory and Microsoft Office/Windows; ServiceNow and Linux appear but the JD-required items like Office 365/SharePoint, Windows Server 2012/2016/2019, Microsoft Azure, patch-management, imaging systems and enterprise endpoint protection are missing. Outcomes/metrics: Strong — concrete metrics provided (restored 400+ devices, 100+ white‑glove tickets, 96% cohort graduation, project scale 65k+ records) which substantively support helpdesk/instruction claims. Scoring rationale: moderate responsibility alignment (2/3), limited tool coverage (1/3), excellent measurable outcomes (3/3) = 6, minus 1 for some generic language and missing JD-specific tooling/administration details, yielding the final score.
Impact: Multiple bullets contain clear action verbs, specific metrics, and explicit business outcomes (notably: taught 36 lessons to 200+ learners with a 96% graduation rate; restored over 400 devices; delivered white‑glove service on 100+ tickets; 65,000+ records reported), satisfying the action+metric+outcome requirement overall. Metric quality is strong (precise counts and a percentage, timeframe present in experience). Minor deduction for some vague/high‑level phrasing in the summary and a few bullets (e.g., “enhancing user experience for VIPs,” “ensuring data integrity and viability”) which reduce clarity.
CredTail: Score reflects multiple discrepancies vs the Retrieval Context. Exact matches: name, email, LinkedIn URL, NYC location, IT Instructor Assistant (RF CUNY & Generation USA) with matching dates (Feb 2022–Aug 2023), core skills (Python, Active Directory, Linux, ServiceNow, Microsoft Office), and certifications (AWS Solutions Architect – Associate; Google Cybersecurity & Google Information Support). Partial matches: bachelor degree and institution match (Bachelor of Technology, NYC College of Technology) but GPA differs slightly (3.8 vs 3.78) and graduation month differs (Actual: Expected May 2024; Retrieval: Jun 2024) — date discrepancy penalized. Major discrepancies / missing items (highest impact): Mayor’s Office role in Actual is listed Feb 2024–Present but Retrieval shows IT Support Intern at Mayor’s Office Feb 2024–May 2024 (direct date contradiction and differences in device counts: Actual claims ~400 devices restored vs Retrieval ~800) — penalized as a contradiction. Missing employers from Actual that appear in Retrieval: Amazon Web Services (Solutions Architect Intern, Jun–Sep 2025) and WOPLLI Technologies (Software Developer Intern, Jun–Sep 2024) — each counted as missing high-priority employers. Minor inconsistency: phone number in Structured Profile (347-491-2955) vs Actual (929-305-7353) — Retrieval Artifacts contain the 929 number (supported) but the presence of two numbers is an inconsistency to verify. Summary of deductions applied per evaluation rules: degree/date discrepancy, mayor’s office date contradiction, mismatch in device counts, and two missing employers lead to cumulative penalties that reduce credibility to the minimum. Recommend verifying Mayor’s Office end date and device counts, and confirming the AWS and WOPLLI internships and dates in source documents.",226,2025-12-18 20:11:33.315543,9,0

Tone: The output is well-formatted, grammatically correct, and uses a consistent professional tone with clear headers and contact info. It strongly matches a cloud/data/ML persona (AWS, Bedrock, SageMaker, Glue, QuickSight, FastAPI) and uses action-oriented verbs (Designed, Built, Automated, Fine-tuned) including a concrete metric (processing 1M+ records). Shortcomings: several impact statements lack specific quantification (e.g., “improving accuracy and reducing toxicity” without percent or baseline), there’s occasional jargon (“agentic AI tooling”), and some bullets vary in specificity. Persona alignment is the strongest area, while Professionalism and Action-Oriented are each notably lower and thus flagged for imbalance.
Alignment: Against 21 listed requirements the resume matched ~52% (7 explicit, 8 implied): clear strengths are AWS architecture and infra tooling (EC2, Lambda, Glue, Bedrock, SageMaker), Python, APIs/FastAPI/Postman, CI/CD and a measurable 1M+ record pipeline; key shortcomings are missing senior-level experience (6+ years), leadership/technical-direction evidence, UI work, and C/C++/Java exposure. Penalized for limited company/title-specific seniority and boosted for measurable outcomes/tools.
Impact: High alignment with the evaluation steps: the resume contains multiple explicit action verbs and concrete metrics (e.g., “Automated a sentiment-analysis pipeline processing 1M+ records,” “Delivered 36 lessons for 200+ learners,” GPAs), demonstrating measurable results and ownership (Built POCs, Designed, Automated). Minor shortcomings: a few impact claims are vague or unquantified (e.g., “improving accuracy and reducing toxicity,” “shortens feedback loops” without percent/time/dollar metrics), so a small penalty for lack of full quantification was applied. Overall business impact and clear ownership justified a positive final adjustment.
CredTail: Most key fields are verified: personal info (name, email, phone, location, links) exactly match; summary matches; experience entries (titles, employers, locations, dates, and most highlights) align with the Retrieval Context; education entries (degrees, institutions, dates, GPAs/honors) and certifications match. Partial mismatches: core skills differ slightly (Retrieval lists additional items like R Programming and explicit Security/SIEM skills that are omitted from the Actual Output), and the project tech detail has a small version/terminology difference (GPT-4.1 mini vs “GPT-4 Mini”). No fabricated employers, dates, or degrees were found.

Tone: Professionalism (5): clear, formal formatting and error-free tone with appropriate headings and industry language. Action-Oriented (5): strong action verbs and multiple quantified achievements (e.g., automated pipeline processing 1M+ records, enhanced feedback loops by 5x, reduced application time by 60%, 96% cohort graduation). Persona Alignment (5): content and tone match an early-career data/solutions architect/ML candidate with AWS focus and relevant certifications. Average = 5.0, mapped to a 10/10 overall; highest and lowest are equal (all 5s). Minor shortcoming: a few role bullets (WOPLLI, some IT Support details) could use more specific metrics or outcomes for even greater impact.
Alignment: Extraction & matching: Required items include data collection/analysis, reporting/presentations, collaboration, QA checks, data visualization, database development/maintenance, analytics implementation, relevant degree, proficiency in Excel/SQL/Python, attention to detail, communication, and basic finance knowledge. Direct matches: Python and SQL proficiency (Core Skills); data visualization and dashboards (QuickSight, Power BI; QuickSight dashboards at AWS); database management (PostgreSQL/MySQL/MongoDB, Google Sheets DB project); QA checks (IT Support role + Core Skills); presentations/reports (AWS & WOPLLI presentations/technical docs); collaboration and teamwork (multiple team roles); analytics implementation (POCs with Glue/Athena/Lambda, automated pipeline processing 1M+ records). Paraphrased/implicit: data collection/cleansing and ETL work (implied by pipelines/ETL tools, not explicitly “data cleansing”); communication skills (demonstrated via presentations but not tailored). Missing or weak: Excel is not listed despite being requested; explicit financial domain knowledge/terminology and tailoring to FDR Financial Group are absent. Specificity: strong—several quantified outcomes (1M+ records, 5x feedback loop improvement, 60% time reduction, 96% cohort rate) support credibility. Overall assessment: high match rate and concrete evidence, minus penalties for missing Excel and lack of finance-specific experience/tailoring, so a strong but not perfect fit for the internship.
Impact: Resume contains multiple strong action verbs with specific, quantifiable outcomes (e.g., automated pipeline processing 1M+ records and enhanced feedback loops by 5x; delivered 36 lessons to 200+ learners with a 96% graduation rate; reduced time-to-apply by 60%), demonstrating clear business impact on efficiency and customer outcomes. Deductions for several bullets that are vague or passive (e.g., “significantly reducing manual workload,” POCs without numeric results) and some metrics lack explicit baselines/timeframes, so not perfect.

Tone: High marks across all three evaluation steps. Professionalism: clear, formal tone with good grammar and consistent resume formatting (distinct headings, contact block, polished bullets). Action-oriented: uses strong verbs and outcome language (e.g., “Automated a sentiment-analysis pipeline processing 1M+ records,” “96% cohort graduation rate,” “Built POCs… to deliver actionable sentiment insights”), showing measurable impact where possible. Persona alignment: closely matches a solutions-architect/data-science persona with relevant tech and cloud emphasis (AWS Bedrock, SageMaker, Glue, QuickSight, certifications). No category is ≥1 point lower than the highest, so no imbalance flagged. Minor nit: a few impact statements (e.g., “improving accuracy and reducing toxicity”) could be more quantified, but overall highly aligned with the evaluation criteria.
Alignment: I mapped the 15 job requirements (8 responsibilities + 4 minimum + 3 preferred). Explicit matches: architecting scalable systems, working with varied tech (AWS/Azure/CI/CD/Python), Bachelor degree, and data-driven analysis; Implied matches: cross-functional collaboration, code/perf optimization, mentorship/onboarding, ownership/end-to-end delivery, driving change, Python scripting, and some quality/process exposure; Absent: custom UI/frontend work, the senior 8+ years (or PhD) requirement, and 6+ years large-scale infra / C/C++/Java experience. Match = (4 explicit + 0.5*8 implied)/15 = ~53%, which maps to a mid-range base score (6); I added 1 point for clear measurable outcomes (1M+ records, 96% cohort) and explicit AWS tool use, and applied no boilerplate penalty, yielding a final score of 7.
Impact: High base due to numerous explicit action verbs (Designed, Built, Automated, Fine-tuned) and multiple concrete metrics (pipeline processing 1M+ records, 36 lessons for 200+ learners, 96% cohort graduation rate, GPAs/certs) demonstrating measurable accomplishments. Minor shortcomings: several impact statements lack quantified improvement (e.g., “improving accuracy and reducing toxicity,” “reduce manual workload”) and would benefit from percent/time/dollar metrics. Ownership is explicit in roles and outcomes (real-time QuickSight dashboards, Bedrock/Athena POCs), which restores points for clear business impact.
CredTail: Cross-check shows strong consistency: personal/contact info (email, phone, location, LinkedIn, GitHub) exactly matches the Retrieval Context; employers and roles (AWS Solutions Architect Intern; WOPLLI Software Developer Intern; Mayor’s Office IT Support Intern; RF CUNY & Generation USA Instructor Assistant) and their dates all match exactly; education entries (MS expected Jan 2026 with 4.0 GPA, BS Jun 2024 with 3.78 GPA) match; certifications listed match. Core technologies largely match (AWS services, Python stack, Azure, ETL, QuickSight, SQL/NoSQL, APIs, Docker, Git), but a few core-skill items present in the Retrieval Context (explicit “Generative AI”, R Programming, some security entries) are omitted in the Actual Output (partial/missing). Project artifacts (the “Alfred” project and its tech/details) appear in the Retrieval Context but are missing from the Actual Output. No fabricated employers, degrees, or dates were introduced.

Persona Alignment: largely well-matched to cloud/ML/GenAI roles (AWS, SageMaker, RAG project, Alfred) but slightly overstated seniority — the “over 8 years” claim is not clearly supported by the listed internships and education timeline, creating a minor credibility/timeline mismatch. Category scores used: Professionalism 5, Action-Oriented 5, Persona Alignment 4 (average 4.7/5); no inconsistency flag since no two category scores differ by more than 1.
Alignment: Matched 6 of 8 listed responsibilities (75%): explicit collaboration, system architecture, performance/scalability work, variety of languages/tech, ownership (Alfred project), and code/process optimization are demonstrated; leadership/mentorship and explicit UI/custom front-end implementation are not clearly shown. Tools/technologies match: 2 of 3 cited ML frameworks (PyTorch and scikit-learn) were present (≈67%), plus strong AWS/SageMaker and RAG/PostgreSQL signals. Outcomes/metrics match: multiple concrete KPIs are provided (1M+ records processed, 5× faster feedback-to-action, 5% accuracy gain/8% toxicity reduction, 60% time reduction, 300% application increase, 96% graduation rate), showing strong measurable impact. Applied a 2-point penalty for limited explicit leadership/mentorship and sparse UI/front-end evidence despite an otherwise well-tailored ML resume. Overall assessment combines responsibility (weighted), tool overlap, outcome metrics, and penalization.
Impact: The output includes numerous explicit, action-oriented results with clear numeric metrics tied to outcomes: processed over 1M feedback records enabling a 5× faster feedback-to-action turnaround; fine-tuned models with a 5% accuracy gain and 8% toxicity reduction; RAG/agent reduced application time by 60% and increased completed applications by 300%; 96% cohort graduation rate from 36 lessons for 200+ learners, and >100 VIP tickets supported. Language is mostly active and metric-driven, demonstrating measurable business impact. Minor shortcomings: a few bullets lack deeper business-context and some phrasing is slightly passive, so a small penalty applied for clarity/context.
CredTail: Most key items are directly supported by the retrieval context: both degrees (CUNY SPS MS – Data Science & ML, expected Jan 2026, GPA 4.0; CUNY NYC College of Technology B.Tech – Computer Information Systems, Jun 2024, GPA 3.78, Dean’s List / National Honor Society) match exactly. All listed employers and dates (AWS Solutions Architect Intern Jun 2025–Sep 2025; WOPLLI Jun 2024–Sep 2024; Mayor’s Office IT Support Feb 2024–May 2024; RF CUNY & Generation USA Feb 2022–Aug 2023) and most technologies (AWS services EC2/S3/Lambda/RDS/DynamoDB/Glue/QuickSight/SageMaker, Python/pandas/scikit-learn/PyTorch, FastAPI, PostgreSQL/pgvector, OpenAI GPT-4.1, Docker, Git, SIEM/IDS/Active Directory) are present in the retrieval context. Deductions were applied for minor unsupported or omitted items: the résumé’s claim of “over 8 years of experience” is not supported by the context, the line about leveraging expertise “at Meta” is not present in the retrieval, and a few retrieval technologies/certifications (e.g., Bedrock, Macie, and the Google Information Support Certificate) appear in the context but are omitted in the Actual Output. These are minor omissions/unsupported claims, so the overall credibility is high but not perfect.",235,2025-12-18 20:14:12.467005,9,8
148,1077,P4,9.09090909090909,9.3,6,34.39090909090909,"Punctuality: The score is 0.91 because the actual output conflicts with the retrieval context: it gives phone number 929-305-7353 while the profile phone is 347-491-2955; it lists the IT Support Intern dates as Feb 2024–Present though the context shows Feb 2024–May 2024; and it claims restoring 400+ devices whereas the context documents refurbishing and tracking 800+ devices.
Tone: Professionalism 5: well-formatted, clear, correct grammar, strong header and sections (e.g., contact, summary, skills, education). Action-Oriented 4: many strong action verbs and quantified impacts (e.g., “Restored 400+ devices,” “reduced manual workload by 30%,” “processed 1M+ records,” “96% graduation rate,” Alfred metrics), but a few bullets (e.g., “Developed API integrations,” “Designed and implemented a Virtual Credential System”) lack specific measurable outcomes. Persona Alignment 5: content, technical skills (Python, Go, AWS, SageMaker), certifications, and internships (AWS, solutions architect, developer roles) strongly match a cloud/software engineering/data-science persona. Largest gap is 1 point between Action-Oriented and the other scores due to some unquantified accomplishments. Average of the three = 4.7; scaled to a 0–10 range = 9.3.
Alignment: Responsibilities: Resume partially matches JD — shows Agile/SDLC, API work (WOPLLI API integrations), development languages/frameworks (Go, Angular) and DBs (MongoDB, SQL Server) which are critical; mentoring, end-to-end project ownership, and handling Priority‑1 production incidents are not evidenced (critical gaps). Tools: Strong exact matches for required tools (Go, Angular, MongoDB, SQL Server, AWS, Git, JIRA, Docker); missing/desirable items such as explicit microservices architecture, WCAG accessibility work, and demonstrated test‑automation suites. Outcomes: Resume includes concrete metrics (400+ devices restored; 30% reduction in manual work; 96% graduation rate; 1M+ records processed; model accuracy/toxicity improvements), which is a clear strength. Deductions: language and chronology suggest junior/intern roles despite a “10+ years” claim and limited senior responsibilities — indicates generic or poorly tailored resume. Based on responsibility match (2/3), tools match (3/3), measurable outcomes (3/3), minus penalty for lack of senior tailoring (-2), the final score reflects moderate alignment.
Impact: Strong use of action verbs with measurable results and clear business outcomes across multiple bullets (e.g., ""Restored 400+ devices"" improving operational readiness; ""Automated troubleshooting...reducing manual workload by 30%""; sentiment pipeline processing 1M+ records and improving feedback loops 5x; SageMaker models +5% accuracy/-8% toxicity; Alfred reduced application time 60% and increased applications 300%). Metric quality is high with precise numbers and percentages. Minor weaknesses: a few items use vague impact language without metrics (e.g., ""improving instructional quality and clarity,"" ""enhancing user identity security""), but these are limited and do not outweigh the strong, quantifiable achievements.
CredTail: Strong matches: name, email (Darwhin88@gmail.com), LinkedIn URL, location (New York City), internships at WOPLLI (Jun 2024–Sep 2024) and AWS (Jun 2025–Sep 2025), IT Instructor Assistant (Feb 2022–Aug 2023), Alfred project details (FastAPI, GPT-4.1 integration), education entries (MS expected Jan 2026, BS Jun 2024) and listed certifications are supported by the Retrieval Context. Discrepancies and suspected fabrications: the “10+ years” experience claim is unsupported by the context (and is inconsistent with a BS completed Jun 2024) — suspected fabrication; Mayor’s Office employment dates contradict the Retrieval Context (Actual: Feb 2024–Present vs Retrieval: Feb 2024–May 2024) — direct contradiction; multiple core technologies in the Actual Output are not present in the Retrieval Context (notably Go, PHP, JavaScript, HTML, Angular, and JIRA) and should be verified. Minor/partial mismatches: phone number in Actual (929-305-7353) is present in the Artifacts but differs from the Structured Profile (347-491-2955); device counts in Mayor’s Office highlights differ (400+ vs ~800). Because high-priority items (experience duration and an employer date) are contradicted and several core technologies are unsupported, credibility is severely reduced — verify employer end dates, the “10+ years” claim, and each listed technology against source records.",231,2025-12-18 20:15:16.948204,10,0
149,1095,P1,9.736842105263158,10,6,43.73684210526316,"Punctuality: The score is 0.97 because the only contradiction is a minor mismatch: the retrieval context’s Core Skills list explicitly includes Python (pandas, scikit-learn, seaborn, PyTorch) and SQL/NoSQL but does not list Java, JavaScript, C, C++, or PHP, while the cover letter artifact does mention hands-on experience with Java and JavaScript — a small inconsistency between sections.
Tone: Professionalism: consistently formal, well-structured, and error-free with industry-appropriate terminology (e.g., AWS services, SageMaker). Action-oriented: strong use of action verbs and quantified outcomes (automated pipeline processing 1M+ records, 5× faster feedback loops, ~5% accuracy gain and ~8% toxicity reduction, 60% faster time-to-apply). Persona alignment: tone and content clearly match a solutions-architect/data-science candidate with AWS-focused internships and relevant projects/certifications. All three aspects are equally strong (no highest/lowest divergence), yielding a top-tier average under the provided rubric.
Alignment: Step 1: I extracted core responsibilities and qualifications from the Meta posting (collaboration across product/design/ops, custom UIs, reusable backend components/APIs, performance/scale analysis, technical leadership/ownership, system architecture, multi-language experience) plus minimums (BS or equivalent, 6+ years or PhD option, setting technical direction, maintainable/testable code) and preferred items (6+ years infra, Python/JS/Hack, scalability/stability, ownership, reliability practices, C/C++/Java). Step 2: I compared the resume. Direct matches: API / FastAPI, AWS architectures (EC2/S3/Lambda/Glue/QuickSight), performance/scalability work (automated pipeline processing 1M+ records, 5× faster feedback), multiple languages including Python, Java, JavaScript, C/C++ (explicit). Close/paraphrase matches: cross-functional collaboration (vendor management, teaching, communications), architecting scalable systems (AWS reference architectures), ownership evidence via projects/POCs (but not explicit long-term component ownership), testing/quality practices implied (Postman, monitoring dashboards) but lacking explicit unit-test/code-review leadership. No mention / missing: implementing custom user interfaces (no UI work shown), 6+ years of professional programming or 6+ years infra experience (candidate is early-career with internships and an expected MS), clear track record of setting technical direction or leading teams (no senior/lead roles), and explicit experience with formal rollout/QA/code-review processes. Step 3: Specificity: the resume provides strong quantified outcomes (1M+ records, 5× faster, ~5% accuracy gain, 8% toxicity reduction, 60% time reduction), and named tools (AWS, SageMaker, Glue, Lambda, DynamoDB, QuickSight, FastAPI, Docker, Git, Python, Java, JS, C/C++). Step 4 / Scoring rationale: given solid tooling and measurable technical impact (supports many infra requirements) but clear gaps on seniority, long-term ownership, explicit leadership, and UI experience, the match is moderate. I counted roughly 10 direct matches, about 6 partial/paraphrase matches, and about 4 strong misses on senior-level requirements; this balance and the importance Meta places on 6+ years and leadership justify a mid-high score.
Impact: High presence of active verbs plus multiple clear, quantifiable outcomes: automated sentiment pipeline processing 1M+ records with 5× faster feedback loops; fine-tuned models improving accuracy ~5% and reducing toxicity ~8%; project reducing time-to-apply by 60%; IT instruction delivered 36 lessons to 200+ learners with a 96% graduation rate; 100+ tickets handled. These metrics tie to speed, accuracy, and customer outcomes. Deductions for a few vague/passive bullets lacking measurable impact (e.g., “designed and presented secure, scalable AWS reference architectures,” POC outcomes, some Software Developer tasks and vendor management without baseline/timeframe).
CredTail: Education: fully VERIFIED — MS (expected Jan 2026, GPA 4.0, Dean’s List 2x) and B.Tech (Jun 2024, GPA 3.78, Dean’s List, National Honor Society) match Retrieval Context → Education subscore 10/10. Experience: fully VERIFIED — all four roles, employers and dates (AWS Solutions Architect Intern Jun 2025–Sep 2025; WOPLLI Jun 2024–Sep 2024; Mayor’s Office Feb 2024–May 2024; IT Instructor Assistant Feb 2022–Aug 2023) appear in the Retrieval Context → Experience subscore 10/10. Core Skills: mostly VERIFIED (Python + libraries, SQL, AWS services listed, Azure services, ETL/ELT, APIs, Docker, Git, security items, SDLC/Agile/OOP, etc.), but several claimed programming languages (C, C++, PHP) are ABSENT from the Retrieval Context and thus treated as missing/fabrications. Proportion verified yields ~9/10 but a strong penalty for fabricated/missing items reduces Core Skills to ~7/10. Aggregating the three category subscores (10, 10, 7) and applying the fabrication penalty gives a final credibility score of 9/10. Fabricated/missing items: C, C++, PHP.",243,2025-12-18 20:16:03.312326,9,9
150,635,P3,9.777777777777777,10,8,45.77777777777778,"Punctuality: The score is 0.98 because the only contradiction is a minor phrasing error: the retrieval context describes Darwhin as a “solutions-focused technologist” experienced in designing AWS architectures, automated data pipelines, and agentic AI tooling, but the actual output incorrectly labels him a “Detail-oriented Data Analyst Intern.” The profile does note he is pursuing an MS in Data Science and Machine Learning, so the mismatch is limited to wording rather than substantive factual error.
Tone: High professionalism: formal tone, error-free grammar, clear layout and headings (PROFESSIONAL SUMMARY, CORE SKILLS, EDUCATION). Strong action-orientation: uses active verbs (Designed, Built, Automated, Fine-tuned, Developed) and numerous quantified achievements (1M+ records, 5× faster feedback loops, ~5% accuracy gain, ~8% toxicity reduction, 60% faster application time, 96% graduation rate). Persona alignment: skills and projects map well to a Data Analyst/ML intern (Python, SQL, QuickSight/Power BI, SageMaker, FastAPI + GPT-4 project) and support the stated target (FDR Financial Group). Category consistency: all three component scores are high and none differ by more than one. Minor note: some AWS Solutions Architect phrasing is senior/cloud-focused, which could slightly oversell an intern-level data analyst role, but it remains relevant. Overall alignment with the evaluation steps is strong.
Alignment: Resume maps well to the internship requirements: 7 of 8 core responsibilities are demonstrated (data collection/analysis via a sentiment-analysis pipeline, visualization with QuickSight, collaboration/cross-functional work, ETL/data modeling, building analytics solutions and database-related work) while only explicit QA processes are less clearly stated. Tools/technologies match is strong—Python and SQL are present and visualization tools (QuickSight/Power BI) are listed—covering the key tool mentions from the job posting; Excel is missing. Measurable outcomes are well documented and tied to responsibilities (1M+ records processed, 5× faster dashboards/feedback loops, ~5% accuracy improvement, ~8% toxicity reduction, 60% reduction in time-to-apply, 96% cohort graduation), satisfying the outcomes/KPI requirement. The resume is tailored (summary references contributing to FDR) and uses role-specific language, so no generic-application penalty applies. Minor shortcoming: lack of an explicit line about formal data quality/QA checks and absence of Excel mention.
Impact: The resume contains multiple explicit, action-oriented statements with quantifiable outcomes (e.g., automated a sentiment pipeline processing 1M+ records with 5× faster feedback loops; fine-tuned models improving accuracy ~5% and reducing toxicity ~8%; maintained a 96% cohort graduation rate; reduced time-to-apply by 60%). Language is primarily active (Designed, Built, Automated, Fine-tuned), and metrics are specific and tied to operational/model improvements, meeting the evaluation criteria for measurable business impact. Minor shortcoming: a few metrics lack broader business context or baseline details, but overall the output strongly follows the steps for specificity and measurable results.
CredTail: Following the retrieval-check step, nearly all factual claims in the Actual Output are directly supported by the Retrieval Context: the two degrees and dates (M.S. expected Jan 2026; B.Tech Jun 2024), contact/LinkedIn, employers and dates for AWS (Jun 2025–Sep 2025), WOPLLI (Jun 2024–Sep 2024), Mayor’s Office (Feb 2024–May 2024), and RF CUNY/Generation (Feb 2022–Aug 2023), plus projects (Alfred) and listed certifications and many core technologies (Python with pandas/scikit-learn/seaborn, QuickSight/Power BI, SageMaker, FastAPI, Postman, AWS Glue/Bedrock, SQL/NoSQL) all appear in the context. One fabrication was introduced: the resume’s summary references contributing to “FDR Financial Group,” which does not appear in the retrieval context and therefore warranted a penalty. Minor omission: the Actual Output omitted PyTorch from the Python stack present in the context (small omission). Deduction applied for the fabricated employer, resulting in a high-but-not-perfect credibility/completeness score.",240,2025-12-18 20:16:58.039957,10,8
151,1069,P2,10,9,7,42,"Punctuality: The score is 1.00 because there are no contradictions listed, indicating the actual output fully aligns with the retrieval context — nice work!
Tone: Professionalism 5 — resume is formal, grammatically sound, and well-organized (clear headings, contact info, education). Action-Oriented 4 — uses strong verbs (Designed, Built, Automated, Fine-tuned) and includes measurable items (1M+ records processed, 36 lessons for 200+ learners, GPA 4.0), but many bullets lack explicit impact metrics (no % improvements, cost/latency reductions). Persona Alignment 5 — excellent match for cloud/data/ML roles (AWS services, SageMaker/Bedrock LLMs, Glue, QuickSight, ETL pipelines). Average score converts to a 0–10 scale as 9. Flag: Action-Oriented is 1 point below the highest score, indicating a slight imbalance to address by adding more outcome metrics.
Alignment: Baseline match 11/16 (68.8%) → mid-range rating: resume explicitly demonstrates key skills required by the listing (Python, SQL/relational DBs, extensive AWS infra experience — EC2/S3/Lambda/Glue, Bedrock, SageMaker, FastAPI/APIs, microservices, and a relevant Bachelor’s degree) and includes measurable outcomes (automated sentiment pipeline processing 1M+ records), but it lacks evidence of the required C/C++/Java/C# coursework or projects, front-end JS/HTML/CSS work, explicit test coverage or release-process mastery; +1 applied for measurable outcomes/tools, no boilerplate penalty.
Impact: Strong use of active verbs (Designed, Built, Automated, Fine‑tuned) and includes concrete metrics—an automated sentiment pipeline processing 1M+ records and 36 lessons delivered to 200+ learners, plus GPAs and certifications—so it meets the requirement for some measurable results. Shortcomings: several impact statements lack quantification or clear business outcomes (e.g., “improving accuracy and reducing toxicity” and POCs/architectures are not tied to percent/time/dollar improvements), which introduces vagueness and warrants a penalty. Ownership is generally explicit and the pipeline/dashboard work ties to business insights, supporting a modest positive adjustment.
CredTail: Degrees match exactly (MS expected Jan 2026; BTech Jun 2024). Employers and dates are exact matches for AWS (Jun–Sep 2025), WOPLLI (Jun–Sep 2024), Mayor’s Office (Feb–May 2024), and RF CUNY/Generation (Feb 2022–Aug 2023). Core technologies largely match (Python, SQL/NoSQL, AWS services including Bedrock/SageMaker/Glue/QuickSight, FastAPI, Docker, Git), but the Actual Output omits or condenses several items present in the Retrieval Context (explicit “Generative AI” label, R programming/statistical ML entries, certain security items like SIEM/CrowdStrike) and drops specific numeric metrics (e.g., ~5% accuracy gain, ~8% toxicity reduction, 5× faster) — so core tech and performance claims are a partial match rather than exact. No fabricated employers, degrees, or dates were found. Because key fields are verified with only minor omissions, the score is reduced modestly from perfect.",254,2025-12-18 20:17:04.636377,7,9

Tone: Professionalism: very high — clear, grammatical, well-structured resume with consistent headings, contact links, and education/work formatting. Action-Oriented: very strong — uses active verbs (Built, Fine-tuned, Automated, Designed) and multiple quantified outcomes (1M+ records, 5x faster feedback loops, 5% accuracy gain / 8% toxicity reduction, 96% cohort graduation rate, 60% time reduction, 300% application increase). Persona Alignment: excellent — content and skills directly match cloud/ML/Solutions Architect roles (AWS, SageMaker, FastAPI, CI/CD, cloud/data/AI tooling). Scores are consistent (no notable gap between components); average of the three 1–5 component scores is 5.0, indicating top alignment with the evaluation criteria.
Alignment: Step 1 (responsibilities): Resume explicitly matches architecting scalable systems (Solutions Architect intern, AWS services), building ML pipelines (sentiment analysis pipeline, SageMaker fine-tuning), working across multiple technologies/languages (Python, SQL, PyTorch, scikit-learn), and evidence of ownership (Alfred project with CI/CD) — these are treated as critical/strong matches. Missing or weak matches include explicit cross-functional collaboration with product/design, front-end/UI implementation, senior-level team direction/mentorship at scale, and formal ownership/onboarding described in the JD. Step 2 (tools): Strong matches for core tools: AWS (SageMaker, EC2, S3, Lambda), PyTorch, scikit-learn, Git, Docker, CI/CD; missing TensorFlow and explicit information-retrieval tooling. Step 3 (outcomes): Resume provides multiple concrete metrics (1M+ records, 5x faster feedback loops, +5% accuracy, −8% toxicity, 60% reduction in application time, 300% increase in applications, 96% graduation rate), which is a major strength. Step 4 (scoring): Given moderate responsibility alignment, good tooling overlap, and strong measurable outcomes — but penalized for not meeting the senior years requirement, limited evidence of organization-level leadership and cross-functional/product collaboration — the overall alignment is mid-level.
Impact: Most bullets include an action verb, measurable result, and business outcome (e.g., “Built…processing 1M+ records, enabling 5x faster feedback loops”; “Fine‑tuned…improving accuracy by 5% and reducing toxicity by 8%”; “Alfred…reduced job application time by 60% and increased applications by 300%”; “Achieved 96% cohort graduation rate for 200+ learners”), which satisfies the primary evaluation criterion. Metric quality is high with precise numbers and percentages, earning full credit. Minor shortcomings: a few items are vague or unquantified (e.g., “Designed Virtual Credential System” lacks measurable impact; “enhancing deployment efficiency” and “reducing manual workload significantly” use non‑specific language), so a small penalty for vagueness is applied.
CredTail: Start at 10. Strong matches: name, location, email, phone, LinkedIn/GitHub links; both list the same degrees, institutions and expected/graduation dates (MSc expected Jan 2026; B.Tech Jun 2024); employers, job titles and employment dates match exactly for AWS, WOPLLI, Mayor’s Office, and RF CUNY/Generation USA; project Alfred and many techs align (FastAPI, OpenAI GPT-4.1, Docker, CI/CD, SageMaker, Glue, QuickSight, Python/pandas/scikit-learn/PyTorch, SQL/NoSQL, SIEM/ActiveDirectory/Linux). Partial/ inconsistent items: honors counts differ (Actual: “Dean’s List (8x)” vs Retrieval: Master 2x + Bachelor 5x = 7) — small inconsistency. Missing fields (penalized): Retrieval lists an additional certification (“Google Information Support Certificate”) that is omitted in the Actual Output (−2); Retrieval’s core_skills include AWS Bedrock and Macie which are not listed in Actual Technical Skills (count as two missing high-priority core technologies, −2 each = −4). No direct contradictions or clear fabrications found. Deductions total −6, yielding the final credibility score. Recommend verifying the omitted certification, the presence/use of Bedrock and Macie, and the honors count with source documents.",236,2025-12-18 20:18:05.671503,10,4

Tone: Professionalism 5 — consistently formal, well-structured, and industry-appropriate (clear headings, certifications, concise summaries). Action-Oriented 5 — frequent strong verbs and quantified outcomes (e.g., “1M+ records,” “5× faster feedback loops,” ~5% accuracy gain, ~8% toxicity reduction, 96% graduation rate). Persona Alignment 5 — tone, technical detail (AWS services, SageMaker, FastAPI, pgvector), and accomplishments align well with an early-career solutions architect/data-science candidate. Average = 5.0 (all categories tied as highest and lowest).
Alignment: Following the evaluation steps: I extracted key responsibilities/tools (cross-functional collaboration; custom UIs; code quality/performance analysis and reviews; team leadership/mentorship; architecture of scalable systems; performance/scalability remediation; multiple languages incl. C/C++/Java and scripting like Python/JS; ownership of components; degree and 8+ years experience; use of data/analysis). Matched items: direct matches for cloud/infra skills and tools (explicit AWS services, Glue, Athena, SageMaker) and data pipelines/ETL (direct); programming languages include Python, Java, JavaScript (direct); concrete, quantified outcomes provided (automated pipeline processing 1M+ records; “5× faster feedback loops”; model accuracy/toxicity improvements) (direct). Close/paraphrase matches: system architecture work via “designed and presented secure, scalable AWS reference architectures” and POCs (paraphrase of architecting scalable systems). Missing or weak: seniority/experience requirement (no 8+ years; only internships and recent grad dates), leadership/mentorship and driving large initiatives (no evidence of setting direction or onboarding teams), explicit experience with C/C++ (not listed), explicit code-review/testing/monitoring practices and ownership of components/features (not stated), custom user interfaces (no mention), and explicit examples of using data/analysis to drive org-level change (limited to project metrics). Overall specificity is moderate due to useful quantifications and named tools, but major penalties for lack of senior/leadership experience and several missing responsibilities from the Meta posting. Score reflects a low-to-moderate match given tool overlap but substantive gaps in senior qualifications and role responsibilities.
Impact: Strong presence of action verbs with multiple clear, specific metrics — e.g., automated sentiment pipeline processing 1M+ records with 5× faster feedback loops, fine-tuned models improving accuracy ~5% and reducing toxicity ~8%, delivered 36 lessons to 200+ learners with a 96% graduation rate, and handled 100+ VIP tickets — all tie to throughput, quality, and customer outcomes. Deductions for several bullets that lack measurable results or business context (e.g., “Designed and presented secure, scalable AWS reference architectures,” “Built POCs,” and project/ internship bullets without metrics) and a few metrics missing baseline/timeframe context, so not perfectly uniform across the resume.
CredTail: All claims in the Actual Output are directly supported by the Retrieval Context. Education entries (M.S. Data Science & Machine Learning, expected Jan 2026 with 4.0 GPA and Dean’s List 2x; B.Tech CIS Jun 2024 with 3.78 GPA, Dean’s List 5x, National Honor Society) are VERIFIED.

Tone: Professionalism 5: polished, formal tone with clear sections and good grammar. Action-Oriented 5: strong verbs and multiple quantified impacts (e.g., “1M+ records,” “improving accuracy by ~5%,” “reducing application time by 60%,” “96% graduation rate”). Persona Alignment 4: generally fits a software/solutions-architect or ML/data role (AWS internship, SageMaker work, relevant certifications), but the claim of “over 6 years of experience” is inconsistent with the timeline (mainly internships and recent degrees 2022–2025), causing a minor seniority misalignment. Average = 4.7 (scaled to a 9/10). No category pair differs by more than 1, so scores are consistent.
Alignment: Step 1 (responsibilities): Resume matches 7 of 9 core responsibilities (collaboration, API development, code optimization, architecting scalable systems, resolving performance/scalability issues, multi-language work, and component ownership via projects) but lacks explicit UI implementation and clear leadership/technical guidance for a senior role — yielding ~3.9/5. Step 2 (tools/technologies): All key languages called out by the job (Python, JavaScript, C, C++, Java) appear on the resume (5/5) — full 2.5/2.5. Step 3 (outcomes/metrics): The resume includes concrete metrics (1M+ records pipeline, 5x feedback loop improvement, ~5% accuracy gain, 60% faster application time, 96% course graduation), demonstrating measurable impact but not all tied to senior infra KPIs (estimated ~2.0/2.5). Penalization: resume leans on internships/projects and provides limited evidence of senior leadership/long‑term ownership and production reliability practices, so apply a -2 penalty. Weighted sum (3.9 + 2.5 + 2.0) minus 2 penalty ≈ 6.4, rounded to a final score of 6.
Impact: Includes multiple explicit, action-oriented accomplishments with concrete metrics (e.g., automated sentiment pipeline processing 1M+ records and improving feedback loops by 5x; model fine-tuning: +~5% accuracy and -8% toxicity; 96% graduation rate for 200+ learners; project reduced application time by 60%). These are clear, measurable outcomes tied to product/user impact, earning a high mark under the rubric. Some entries remain vague or lack business context (e.g., Azure configuration, troubleshooting automation without quantified impact), so a small penalty for incomplete context/passive details is applied.
CredTail: The resume largely matches the retrieval context: personal info, LinkedIn/GitHub, both degrees (MS expected Jan 2026 and BS Jun 2024 with GPAs/honors), all listed internships and exact dates (AWS Jun–Sep 2025; WOPLLI Jun–Sep 2024; Mayor’s Office Feb–May 2024; RF CUNY Feb 2022–Aug 2023), the Alfred project details, AWS/Azure components, APIs/Tools, and certifications are all directly supported. Shortcomings: the summary claim of “over 6 years of experience” is not present in the retrieval context (unsupported/fabricated), and C and C++ listed under programming languages do not appear anywhere in the retrieval artifacts (missing). These three unsupported/missing items justify a modest deduction for minor fabrications/omissions.",245,2025-12-18 20:19:53.573666,8,7

Tone: Professionalism: strong formal tone, clear grammar, consistent resume structure (education, experience, projects, skills), but minor formatting choices (name in all caps) and occasional brevity in bullets — scored 4/5. Action-Oriented: many strong action verbs (Designed, Configured, Automated, Developed) and a few measurable outcomes (96% cohort graduation rate; optimized queries for a 65,000+ record DB) but several bullets lack quantified impact — scored 4/5. Persona Alignment: excellent match to data science/IT roles with relevant projects (ARIMA, Isolation Forest), cloud and security certifications, and toolset (Python, R, MSSQL, Docker) — scored 5/5. Average of these ratings yields a high overall rating; final numeric score reflects that. Note: Professionalism and Action-Oriented are each one point lower than the highest category (Persona Alignment), indicating minor imbalances to address.
Alignment: Job required: SQL, Excel, VBA, Python; market/Front Office risk experience; prototype development (python/SQL/Excel/VBA); financial markets product knowledge; regulatory understanding; partnering with GMFR/GRA/MRM. Resume explicitly lists Python and SQL, implies prototype/POC work and some financial projects (stocks report, ATM forecasting, anomaly detection) and includes measurable outcomes (65k query optimization, 96% cohort graduation). It omits Excel and VBA, lacks explicit market‑risk/Front Office and regulatory experience, and shows no partnership with GMFR/GRA/MRM. Calculated match ≈39% (mid‑low range); I applied a +1 for measurable outcomes/explicit tool use and −1 for missing role‑specific risk/regulatory experience and non‑tailored language, yielding the reported score.
Impact: High rating due to multiple explicit action verbs and several concrete metrics: delivered 36 lessons to 200+ learners, achieved a 96% cohort graduation rate, optimized queries for a 65,000+ record database, and automated troubleshooting (reduced manual workload). Minor shortcomings: several bullets (e.g., “Designed a Virtual Credential System,” “Configured and tested Azure environments”) lack quantified business impact or measurable outcomes, so a small penalty was applied. Overall ownership and clear outcomes in key items justify the final score.
CredTail: Degrees are exact matches (MS Data Science & Machine Learning expected Jan 2026; B.Tech Computer Information Systems Jun 2024, GPA 3.78, Dean’s List/NHS). Contact info and links match (New York, Darwhin88@gmail.com, 347-491-2955, LinkedIn, GitHub). Three employers and dates in the Actual Output match the Retrieval Context exactly (WOPLLI Technologies Jun 2024–Sep 2024; Mayor’s Office Feb 2024–May 2024; RF CUNY & Generation USA Feb 2022–Aug 2023). Certifications listed also match. Core technologies partially match (Python, SQL/R, Docker, Power BI, MSSQL/MySQL/NoSQL appear) but several retrieval core items are missing from the Actual Output (detailed AWS services, Azure specifics, QuickSight/Bedrock/SageMaker, FastAPI/pgvector project tech). One significant employer/role from the Retrieval Context (Solutions Architect Intern at AWS, Jun 2025–Sep 2025) is missing from the Actual Output. Multiple projects in the Actual Output are not present in the Retrieval Context (unverified/fabricated). Because major education and most employer/date fields are verified but there are a missing critical employer role, partial core-tech coverage, and unverified projects, the score reflects these minor-to-moderate inconsistencies.",259,2025-12-18 20:19:56.277725,9,7
156,635,P4,8.96551724137931,10,6,35.96551724137931,"Punctuality: The score is 0.90 because the actual output contains three clear contradictions with the retrieval context: it lists phone 929-305-7353 while the retrieval (and artifact) shows 347-491-2955 (347 491 2955), it describes the Mayor's Office role as 'Volunteer ... Feb 2024 – Current' whereas retrieval records 'IT Support Intern' that ended May 2024, and it claims restoring over 400 devices contrary to the retrieval's 'refurbished and tracked over 800 devices'.
Tone: Professionalism: very strong — clear headings, consistent formatting, and grammatically sound summary and bullets. Action-oriented: highly focused on outcomes with strong verbs and multiple quantified results (e.g., 1M+ records, 5x faster feedback loops, 96% graduation rate, restored 400+ devices, +5% model accuracy / -8% toxicity). Persona alignment: excellent fit for data/cloud/solutions-architect roles (AWS, SageMaker, QuickSight, ETL) and the internship/education timeline. The three criteria are consistent with no significant gaps between them.
Alignment: Responsibility alignment: Several critical responsibilities are explicitly present—collecting/analyzing data (sentiment-analysis pipeline processing 1M+ records), supporting/implementing analytics solutions (automated pipeline, SageMaker model tuning), and data visualization skills (QuickSight, Power BI) — count: 3 critical matches. Missing or not explicit: conducting QA checks, assisting in preparing reports/presentations, and limited explicit collaboration examples tied to business decisions. Tools/technologies: Strong exact matches for required tools—Python (pandas, scikit-learn) and SQL/NoSQL; Excel (called out in the JD) is not listed. Outcomes/metrics: Strong, quantifiable results are provided (1M+ records, 5x faster feedback loops, ~5% model accuracy improvement, 8% toxicity reduction, 96% cohort graduation rate), which supports measurable impact. Deduction: resume lacks finance-specific project tailoring and explicit QA/reporting duties. Scoring rationale applies the rubric (responsibilities ~2/3, tools 3/3, measurable outcomes 3/3, minus 2 for limited tailoring/generic gaps) resulting in the final score.
Impact: Most experience bullets include an action verb, measurable result, and clear business outcome (e.g., automated sentiment pipeline processing 1M+ records with 5x faster feedback loops; fine-tuned SageMaker models improving accuracy ~5% and reducing toxicity ~8%; delivered 36 lessons to 200+ learners with a 96% graduation rate; restored over 400 devices improving operational efficiency). Metric quality is generally strong (many precise counts and %s) but lacks defined timeframes, so I awarded a modest metric bonus. I applied a small penalty for one mildly vague phrase (“reducing manual workload significantly”) rather than a specific reduction. Overall the output demonstrates strong alignment with the action+metric+outcome requirement with only minor clarity/metric-timing weaknesses.
CredTail: Evidence-based comparison: Exact matches — degrees and honors (MSc expected Jan 2026; B.Tech Jun 2024 with GPAs/Dean’s List) are present in the Retrieval Context; AWS Solutions Architect Intern (Jun 2025–Sep 2025) and IT Instructor Assistant (Feb 2022–Aug 2023) entries and the listed certifications and core technologies (Python/pandas/scikit-learn/seaborn, SQL/NoSQL, QuickSight, Power BI, SageMaker, ETL/ELT & data modeling) are explicitly supported. Partial/unsupported items — Mayor’s Office position exists in the Retrieval Context but the Actual Output shows a conflicting date range (Actual: Feb 2024 – Current; Retrieval: Feb 2024 – May 2024) and a different accomplishment metric (Actual: restored 400+ devices; Retrieval: refurbished/tracked 800+ devices). Missing items — the Software Developer Intern role at WOPLLI Technologies (Jun 2024–Sep 2024) present in the Retrieval Context is omitted from the Actual Output. Minor mismatch — phone number differs (Actual: 929-305-7353; Retrieval: 347-491-2955). Scoring deductions applied per instructions: -4 for the direct date contradiction (Mayor’s Office), -2 for the omitted WOPLLI employer, and -2 for the contradictory device-count accomplishment, yielding the final credibility score. Recommend verifying Mayor’s Office employment end date and device counts, confirming the WOPLLI internship, and correcting the phone number if necessary.",241,2025-12-18 20:21:16.902438,9,2

Tone: Professionalism: 5 — resume is formal, well-structured, industry-appropriate, and largely error-free with clear headings and contact info. Action-Oriented: 5 — uses strong action verbs and provides quantified results (automated pipeline processing 1M+ records; 5× faster feedback loops; ~5% accuracy gain and ~8% toxicity reduction; 60% faster time-to-apply). Persona Alignment: 5 — tone, skills, internships, AWS/ML focus and certifications align well with a solutions-focused technologist / early-career cloud/data role. Average (1–5 scale): 5. Highest/lowest: all categories equal. Minor shortcoming: could strengthen senior-level impact/context (business outcomes or stakeholder scope) and ensure chronology clarity between education and internships.
Alignment: Strong alignment with many minimum qualifications: resume shows a completed Bachelor’s in a related field, internships and projects demonstrating coding in Java and C#, Python web app (FastAPI), JavaScript/HTML/CSS, SQL/relational DBs, and substantial AWS infrastructure/ETL experience (POC processing 1M+ records, 5× faster pipelines). Named tools match (AWS services, SageMaker, Glue, QuickSight, FastAPI). Evidence is specific and quantified (processing volume, accuracy/toxicity improvements, 60% reduction in application time). Shortcomings: no explicit mention of test coverage/unit tests or formal release/dev-standards mastery, limited evidence of long-term product-area/codebase ownership (roles are mostly internships/architect POC work), and no C/C++ listed (but Java/C# present). Overall high match rate with some penalties for missing explicit testing/release practices and product ownership, leading to a near-top score.
Impact: Strong presence of action verbs and multiple specific, measurable outcomes (e.g., automated pipeline processing 1M+ records, 5× faster feedback loops, ~5% accuracy improvement and ~8% toxicity reduction, 60% faster time-to-apply, 96% cohort graduation rate, 200+ learners). Metrics tie to efficiency, accuracy, and user outcomes and are presented actively (automated, built, fine-tuned, developed). Minor deductions because a few bullets (e.g., reference architectures, POCs) lack explicit metrics or baselines/timeframes, and some improvements use approximate values, so not every bullet provides full business-context detail.
CredTail: Education: both degrees (MS Data Science expected Jan 2026, BS Computer Information Systems Jun 2024) are VERIFIED in the Retrieval Context (subscore 10/10). Experience: all four roles (Solutions Architect Intern at AWS Jun 2025–Sep 2025; Software Developer Intern WOPLLI Jun 2024–Sep 2024; IT Support Intern Mayor’s Office Feb 2024–May 2024; IT Instructor Assistant Feb 2022–Aug 2023) including dates and highlights are VERIFIED (subscore 10/10). Core Skills: the majority of listed technologies (Python + libs, SQL/NoSQL, AWS services including Bedrock/Macie/SageMaker, Azure App Service/Functions/Storage, Glue/SSIS, Postgres/MySQL/Oracle/MongoDB, QuickSight, CI/CD, Docker, FastAPI, Postman, etc.) are VERIFIED in the Retrieval Context; however C#, HTML, and CSS from the Actual Output are absent (MISSING) and thus treated as fabrications for this test — this triggered a strong penalty reducing the Core Skills subscore (assigned 6/10). No items were CONTRADICTED. Aggregation: (Education 10 + Experience 10 + Core Skills 6)/3 = 8.67 → rounded to a final credibility score of 9. Key determinants: full verification of degrees, employers and dates, and three missing core-skill claims (C#, HTML, CSS) which produced the penalty.",253,2025-12-18 20:21:28.165,9,9

Tone: Professionalism: 5 — polished, formal tone with clear headings, correct grammar, and consistent formatting. Action-Oriented: 5 — strong action verbs and quantified impacts throughout (e.g., 1M+ records, 5× faster feedback loops, ~5% accuracy gain, 60% time reduction, 300% application increase). Persona Alignment: 3 — technical skills and cloud/AI focus fit the target role, but the résumé’s seniority claim (“over 8 years”) conflicts with internship timeline and recent degrees, creating a misalignment for a senior Meta-level persona. Average = 4.3. Inconsistency flagged: Professionalism and Persona differ by more than 1, indicating a tone/experience mismatch to resolve.
Alignment: Responsibilities: 6 of 8 responsibilities were demonstrably matched (collaboration, performance optimization, architecture, scalability, multi-language experience, component ownership via projects/PPOCs), while UI implementation and explicit team leadership/goal-setting/mentorship were not clearly shown. Tools/technologies: strong overlap with preferred items — C, C++, Java, Python, JavaScript, AWS, Docker/CI-CD and microservices are all listed in the resume, yielding a high match rate. Outcomes/metrics: multiple measurable results are present and tied to work (1M+ records pipeline, 5× faster feedback loops, ~5% accuracy gain / 8% toxicity reduction, 60% time reduction / 300% application increase, 96% cohort graduation), supporting full credit for outcomes. No significant generic-tailoring penalty applied because the resume includes infrastructure-specific language (architectures, scalable systems, cloud). Based on weighted scoring (responsibilities ~3.75/5, tools ~2.5/2.5, outcomes ~2.5/2.5) and no penalty, the final rounded score is 9.
Impact: Strong presence of action-oriented, measurable achievements: e.g., automated sentiment pipeline processing 1M+ records with 5× faster feedback loops, fine-tuned models improving accuracy ~5% and reducing toxicity ~8%, Alfred project reducing time-to-apply by 60% and boosting weekly applications by 300%, and a 96% cohort graduation rate for 200+ learners. These metrics tie directly to operational and user-impact outcomes (per Step 1/2). Minor shortcomings: occasional vague phrasing (“driving significant improvements in application throughput and efficiency”) and limited contextual business impact for some percentages, and a few passive-style lines — warranting a small penalty under Step 3.
CredTail: Most factual items are supported: name, contact links, education (MS expected Jan 2026, BS Jun 2024 with GPAs/honors), employers and dates (AWS Jun–Sep 2025, WOPLLI Jun–Sep 2024, Mayor’s Office Feb–May 2024, RF CUNY/Generation Feb 2022–Aug 2023), cloud/data technologies (AWS EC2/S3/Lambda/RDS, Glue, SageMaker, QuickSight; Azure App Service/Functions), certifications, and the Alfred project all appear in the retrieval context. Two unsupported/fabricated items caused deductions: the “over 8 years of experience” claim is not present in the context, and C and C++ are listed among programming languages though they do not appear in the retrieval data.

Tone: High marks across all three areas. Professionalism: clear, well-structured resume with consistent tone and good grammar. Action-oriented: uses strong verbs and measurable outcomes (e.g., “Automated a sentiment-analysis pipeline processing 1M+ records,” “96% cohort graduation rate,” fine-tuning models in SageMaker). Persona alignment: excellent fit for cloud/ML/data roles—skills and experience (AWS, Bedrock, SageMaker, QuickSight, relevant internships and certifications) directly match the target persona. Minor shortcoming: a few bullets lack quantification and there are small punctuation/formatting inconsistencies, but no category is notably weaker than the others.
Alignment: I extracted ~20 key requirements (leadership, Java/Spring/React, AWS, GitLab/Git, MongoDB, unit testing, SaaS/5+ yrs, HA web apps, Agile, automation, mentoring, etc.). The resume explicitly matches AWS, Git, MongoDB, Agile, automation, mentoring/training, and a bachelor’s degree (8 explicit), and implies design/implementation/testing/process-improvement/customer-analysis (6 implied), while missing Java/Spring/React, 5+ years SaaS, production/mission-critical maintenance, and leading reviews (6 absent). Match = (8 + 0.5*6)/20 = 55%, which maps to the mid-range score; I applied a one-point penalty for poor alignment with Pearson’s Java/Spring/React and senior/5+yr expectations and a one-point bonus for clear measurable outcomes and explicit use of required cloud/tools, yielding a final score of 6.
Impact: Strong use of action verbs and multiple clear metrics (e.g., automated sentiment pipeline processing 1M+ records, delivered 36 lessons to 200+ learners, maintained a 96% graduation rate, GPAs listed), demonstrating measurable accomplishments—warranting a high score. Some bullet points, however, are vague or unquantified (e.g., “improving accuracy and reducing toxicity,” “designed and presented architectures” without impact metrics), so a modest deduction was applied. Overall ownership is clear and several items tie to business/operational outcomes, justifying the final rating.
CredTail: Degrees match exactly (both MS Data Science & ML expected Jan 2026 and BS CIS Jun 2024). Employers and employment dates match exactly (AWS Jun 2025–Sep 2025; WOPLLI Jun 2024–Sep 2024; Mayor’s Office Feb 2024–May 2024; RF CUNY & Generation Feb 2022–Aug 2023). Core technologies largely match (Python, AWS services including Bedrock/SageMaker, Azure, Glue, QuickSight, Docker, SQL/NoSQL, ML libs), but the retrieval context lists additional explicit items (Generative AI, Security/SIEM, R Programming and finer ML techniques) that are absent/only implied — scored as a partial match. Contact phone is a partial match across artifacts (Actual: 929-305-7353 vs structured profile 347-491-2955). GitHub link and the detailed project (“Alfred”) present in the retrieval context are missing from the Actual Output. Certifications and education honors match. No clear fabrications found. These are minor gaps (one partial core-tech mismatch, one contact discrepancy, a missing project/GitHub) so I deduct modestly from a near-perfect alignment.",264,2025-12-18 20:24:05.25281,8,8

Tone: All three evaluation areas merit top marks. Professionalism: very clean, well‑formatted resume with clear headings, correct grammar, and links (LinkedIn, GitHub). Action‑Oriented: frequent strong action verbs and quantified outcomes (e.g., automated sentiment‑analysis pipeline processing 1M+ records with 5× faster feedback; 30% client satisfaction lift; 40% deployment efficiency; 50% workload reduction; Alfred reduced application time by 60%). Persona Alignment: content closely matches a cloud/data/solutions architect persona (AWS services listed, CI/CD, data pipelines, relevant certifications, MS in Data Science). Scores are consistent with no notable gaps or contradictions.
Alignment: Responsibility match (step 1): Resume explicitly supports 5 of 9 JD responsibilities. Critical matches: Architect efficient/scalable systems (6) — explicit AWS architecture design; Analyze/optimize code & performance (4,7) — multiple performance metrics (5× faster, reduced downtime); Work on a variety of languages (8) — lists Python, JavaScript, Java, C/C++. Optional/partial matches: Develop reusable components/APIs (3) — API work and CI/CD pipelines (partial); Collaborate cross-functional (1) — implied via client satisfaction but not explicit. Missing/absent: Implement custom UIs (2), Lead complex technical/product efforts (5) (no leadership/technical direction claims), Establish ownership of components/features (9). Tools/tech match (step 2): Strong tool overlap — exact matches for Python, JavaScript, Java, C/C++, AWS (EC2/S3/Lambda), Azure, REST/FastAPI, CI/CD; no required tooling from the JD is missing. Outcomes & metrics (step 3): Strong use of concrete metrics (5× faster feedback loops, 30% client satisfaction, 40% deployment efficiency, 25% downtime reduction, 98% satisfaction), which rewards measurable impact. Scoring rationale (step 4): Responsibilities = 2/3 (partial coverage, several critical gaps), Tools = 3/3 (excellent overlap), Measurable outcomes = 3/3 (clear metrics). No exceptional Meta-specific tailoring (+0). Subtract 2 points for missing required senior experience/leadership and lack of demonstrated ownership/tailoring. Final score reflects these factors.
Impact: Per Step 1, most bullets contain an action verb + measurable result + business outcome (e.g., “Automated sentiment-analysis pipeline processing 1M+ records, achieving 5× faster feedback loops”; “Designed…enhancing client satisfaction by 30%”; “Delivered…100+ tickets with 98% satisfaction”). Per Step 2, metrics are precise (counts and percentages such as 1M+, 5×, 30%, 98%, 96%), giving strong metric quality. Per Step 3, language is active and specific with no notable passive vagueness. Overall the output meets the evaluation criteria thoroughly and clearly.
CredTail: Strong alignment on high-priority items: degrees match (MSc Data Science & ML — Expected Jan 2026, GPA 4.0; B.Tech CIS — Jun 2024, GPA 3.78). All employers and employment dates are explicitly supported (Solutions Architect Intern at AWS Jun 2025–Sep 2025; Software Developer Intern at WOPLLI Jun 2024–Sep 2024; IT Support Intern Mayor’s Office Feb 2024–May 2024; IT Instructor Assistant RF CUNY & Generation USA Feb 2022–Aug 2023). Many core technologies are exact matches (Python, SQL/NoSQL, AWS services including EC2/S3/Lambda, Azure App Service/Functions, ETL/ELT, APIs REST/FastAPI, CI/CD, SIEM/Active Directory, Docker/Containerization). Discrepancies: the Actual Output lists C, C++, and .NET which are not present in the Retrieval Context (treated as three missing technologies; −2 each = −6). No degrees or employers are missing or contradicted; dates align. No clear fabrication detected. Score calculation: start 10 −6 for unsupported technologies = 4. Recommend verifying the C/C++/.NET claims (and the phone number, which differs from the Retrieval Context) with source documents.",246,2025-12-18 20:25:04.926645,10,4

Tone: Professionalism 5/5 — consistently formal, well-organized, and error-free with industry-appropriate resume formatting. Action-Oriented 5/5 — uses strong action verbs and quantifies impact (e.g., built a sentiment pipeline processing >1M records enabling 5× faster feedback-to-action, fine-tuned models with +5% accuracy and −8% toxicity, 96% cohort graduation, optimized queries for 65k+ records). Persona Alignment 5/5 — tone and content clearly match a data-science/cloud solutions architect intern transitioning to advanced studies (AWS, SageMaker, FastAPI/GPT-4.1, RAG, CI/CD). Average of the three ratings = 5.0 (all categories equal/highest), scaled to a 0–10 reporting range.
Alignment: Compared the job requirements (SQL, Excel/VBA, Python; Market Risk/Front Office; prototyping with python/SQL/excel/VBA; financial markets product knowledge; regulatory understanding; partnering with GMFR/GRA/MRM) to the resume. Matches: Python and SQL are direct matches (listed in Core Skills and used in projects). Close/paraphrase: prototyping/POC experience present (AWS POC and sentiment pipeline) but not finance-focused and does not cite Excel/VBA. Partial match: financial domain exposure via a Stocks web app and ATM forecasting project (some product knowledge evidence). Missing: explicit Excel/VBA, Market Risk/Front Office experience, regulatory landscape knowledge, and partnerships with GMFR/GRA/MRM. Resume shows strong specificity and quantified outcomes (1M records processed, 5× faster turnaround, 5% accuracy improvement) which increases credibility, but absence of core finance/risk/regulatory items is a major gap for this role. Based on 2 direct matches, 1 close paraphrase, 1 partial, and 4 missing items plus quality of evidence, the fit is limited.
Impact: The resume contains multiple strong action verbs paired with specific, measurable outcomes (e.g., processed over 1M feedback records with a 5× faster feedback-to-action turnaround; +5% accuracy and −8% toxicity from model fine-tuning; 96% cohort graduation; optimized queries for a 65,000+ record DB). By the evaluation rules this yields high marks for presence and business relevance (turnaround time, accuracy, toxicity, graduation rates, performance). However, several bullets remain vague or lack metrics (e.g., “Designed and presented secure, scalable AWS architectures,” “Developed proof-of-concept” and some intern tasks), which warrants a modest deduction for occasional passive/ambiguous language and missing baselines/timeframes. Overall, multiple distinct quantifiable outcomes (5+) and clear business impact justify a high score with a small penalty for unquantified items.
CredTail: Education: All degree claims match the Retrieval Context (Master MS Data Science & ML expected Jan 2026, GPA 4.0; BTech CIS Jun 2024, GPA 3.78, Dean’s List (5x), National Honor Society) — VERIFIED (2/2). Experience: All four roles, employers, locations, dates and highlights (AWS Solutions Architect Intern Jun 2025–Sep 2025; WOPLLI Software Developer Intern Jun 2024–Sep 2024; Mayor’s Office IT Support Feb 2024–May 2024; RF CUNY & Generation USA IT Instructor Assistant Feb 2022–Aug 2023) are present and consistent — VERIFIED (4/4). Core Skills: 12 of 19 explicit technical/skill claims are present in the Retrieval Context (Python, SQL, R, Java, statistical modeling, forecasting, anomaly detection, MSSQL/MS SQL Server, MySQL, NoSQL, Git, Docker, Power BI) = ~63% → raw subscore ~6/10. Several claimed items are absent from the Retrieval Context and thus treated as fabrications/missing: JavaScript; Data Normalization; Tableau; and the explicitly listed soft-skills (Excellent Verbal/Written Communication, Collaboration, Problem-Solving). Because multiple core-technology/skill claims are unsupported, I apply a strong penalty to the Core Skills subscore (reduced to 3/10). Aggregating subscores (Education 10, Experience 10, Core Skills 3) yields a final credibility rating of 8/10. The perfect match on education and experience drives the high score; missing core-skill items (listed above) are the primary reasons the rating is not higher.",258,2025-12-18 20:25:41.955041,9,8
162,1069,P3,10,10,8,45,"Punctuality: The score is 1.00 because the contradictions list is empty, indicating no discrepancies between the actual output and the retrieval context — the output is fully faithful.
Tone: Professionalism 5/5 — resume uses a formal, well-structured tone with clear headings, correct grammar, and professional vocabulary. Action-Oriented 5/5 — strong action verbs (Designed, Built, Automated, Fine-tuned) and multiple quantified outcomes (processed 1M+ records, 5× faster feedback loops, ~5% accuracy improvement, 8% toxicity reduction, 60% time saved, 300% increase in applications) demonstrate impact. Persona Alignment 5/5 — cloud, ML, and software engineering experience and certifications (AWS Solutions Architect, SageMaker work, AWS/Azure tools) align well with the target cloud/ML/software role and Meta ambition. Calculated average = 5.0 (one decimal); no inconsistency flagged (no two category scores differ by more than 1).
Alignment: Responsibilities: Resume demonstrates equivalent experience for the listed role-level responsibilities (designing/developing/testing applications, product and infrastructure assignments, data analysis/programming, SDLC/CI-CD, remote work, judgment on moderate-scope problems), so full allocation under step 1. Tools/technologies: Resume explicitly lists 9 of the JD technologies (Python, Java, C++, C#, SQL/relational DBs, JavaScript, HTML, CSS plus cloud tooling), yielding a high match rate versus the JD toolset. Outcomes/metrics: Several concrete KPIs are provided (pipeline processing 1M+ records, 5× faster feedback loops, +60% time savings, +300% applications, model accuracy/toxicity improvements, 96% cohort graduation), but those metrics are tied to a subset of responsibilities rather than every duty, so the outcome match is moderate. Penalization: No penalty applied because the resume includes role-specific language and an explicit Meta-focused summary. Combining weighted sub-scores from the three steps (responsibilities, tools, outcomes) and applying the above logic produces a final rounded evaluation consistent with the scoring rubric.
Impact: Strong presence of action-oriented, measurable accomplishments: e.g., automated sentiment pipeline processing 1M+ records with 5× faster feedback loops, fine-tuned models improving accuracy ~5% and reducing toxicity ~8%, 60% reduction in application time and 300% increase in weekly applications, and a 96% cohort graduation rate after 36 lessons for 200+ learners. These are clear, business-relevant metrics and active statements. Minor shortcomings: a few bullets are vague or lack numeric impact (e.g., “reduced manual workload” and vendor management), and occasional passive phrasing, so not a perfect score.
CredTail: Most claims are fully supported by the retrieval context: both degrees (M.S. Data Science & ML, expected Jan 2026; B.Tech Computer Information Systems, Jun 2024) and their GPAs/honors match; all listed employers and dates match (AWS Solutions Architect Intern Jun 2025–Sep 2025; WOPLLI Jun 2024–Sep 2024; Mayor’s Office Feb 2024–May 2024; RF CUNY & Generation USA Feb 2022–Aug 2023); projects and certifications (AWS certs, Google certs) are present. Core technologies are largely supported (Python, SQL, AWS EC2/S3/Lambda/RDS, Glue, QuickSight, Bedrock, SageMaker, Azure App Service/Functions, FastAPI, Docker, Git, Postman, Swagger, Postgre/MySQL/Oracle, CI/CD, Agile/Scrum). Deductions were applied for unsupported/fabricated technology claims in the Core Skills section not found in the retrieval context: C++, C#, HTML, and CSS, which reduced the credibility/completeness rating accordingly.",255,2025-12-18 20:27:36.750273,9,8

Tone: High professionalism: formal header, consistent tone, clear grammar, and well-structured sections (Certifications, Education, Experience). Strong action orientation: uses active verbs and measurable outcomes (built a pipeline processing over 1M feedback records, achieved a 5% accuracy gain fine-tuning models, 96% cohort graduation). Excellent persona alignment for cloud/AI roles: lists AWS services (SageMaker, Bedrock), Generative AI work, FastAPI/RAG project, and relevant internships. Minor improvement: a few bullets could add additional quantification or context (e.g., impact on SLA/response time) but overall balanced with no category ≥1 point lower than the highest.
Alignment: Extracted six core requirements from the JD: port ML models into a cross‑platform SDK; bridge Python model work to C++ SDK integration; ensure high‑performance inference on iOS/Android/Linux/Windows; cross‑platform SDK experience; ML model deployment/inference performance; healthcare/ultrasound domain knowledge. The resume shows strong Python, AWS/SageMaker, Docker, CI/CD and measurable outcomes (pipeline processing >1M records, 5% accuracy improvement), but it does not mention C++, mobile (iOS/Android), SDK integration, inference performance work, or healthcare domain experience. That yields roughly 1/6 (~17%) match, placing it in the <25% band. I applied a full 2‑point penalty for ignoring company/domain/title specifics and some generic language, then added 1 point for clear measurable outcomes and explicit cloud/ML tooling, resulting in the final score.
Impact: Strong use of active ownership verbs (Designed, Built, Fine‑tuned, Automated) and multiple concrete metrics (processed over 1M feedback records, a 5% increase in model accuracy and reduced toxicity, 96% cohort graduation rate, GPAs listed) meet the criterion for multiple clear metrics and actions. A few bullets lack quantification (e.g., Azure environment work, some POC descriptions), so minor vagueness is penalized, but explicit business impact (faster feedback‑to‑action dashboards) and clear attribution justify a high score.
CredTail: High fidelity overall: personal info (name, New York location, email, phone), LinkedIn and GitHub URLs, degrees (CUNY SPS MS expected Jan 2026; CUNY NYCCT B.Tech June 2024 with GPA), employers and internship dates (AWS Jun–Sep 2025; WOPLLI Jun–Sep 2024; Mayor’s Office Feb–May 2024; RF CUNY/Generation Feb 2022–Aug 2023), project “Alfred” (FastAPI, PostgreSQL/pgvector, OpenAI GPT-4.1 mini, Docker, CI/CD) and core cloud/AI tech (AWS services, SageMaker, Bedrock, FastAPI, Docker) are exact or close matches to the Retrieval Context. Partial matches: honors detail (resume lists Dean’s List 8x vs Retrieval’s 5x) and some metric specifics (Actual omits the ~8% toxicity reduction reported in Retrieval when describing SageMaker fine-tuning). Missing item: the Retrieval Context lists an additional certification (“Google Information Support Certificate”) that is not present in the Actual Output. No major fabricated employers, degrees, or dates were introduced. Because most critical fields (degree, employer, dates, core technologies) are verified but there is one fabricated/incorrect honors count and one missing certification, the score reflects minor but notable discrepancies.",269,2025-12-18 20:27:50.614954,9,8

Tone: Very professional and well-formatted with clear grammar and headings. Strong action orientation—frequent action verbs and multiple quantified impacts (e.g., improved deployment speed by 30%, processed 1M+ records, 5× faster pipelines, 96% cohort graduation). Persona aligns closely with cloud/data/solutions-architect roles (AWS, SageMaker, CI/CD, relevant certifications). Minor improvement: the summary is brief and a few bullets could add more technical context or scale details.
Alignment: Responsibilities: Resume explicitly matches some critical responsibilities—architecting AWS architectures and scalable systems (Solutions Architect work), multi-language coding (Python, Java, C++, JavaScript), ownership/end-to-end project (Alfred project, pipelines). Missing or weak: cross-functional product/design collaboration, implementing custom UIs, explicit code-review/mentorship/leadership and driving org-level change (critical for senior Meta role). Tools/technologies: Strong matches for required tools—Python, Java, C++, JavaScript, AWS (EC2/S3/Lambda), Azure, CI/CD, microservices, SageMaker; missing niche items (Hack) and limited evidence of large-scale production monitoring/rollout processes. Outcomes/metrics: Resume contains many concrete, quantifiable results (30% faster deployments, 1M+ records, 5× speedup, +40% engagement, 98% satisfaction), which is a strength. Overall assessment: good technical/tool fit and strong measurable outcomes, but substantial mismatch with senior/minimum qualifications (no 8+ years, no demonstrated leadership/mentorship at scale) and limited explicit cross-functional/product work—so scored below midrange.
Impact: Many bullets demonstrate the three required elements: clear action verbs (e.g., Designed, Automated, Developed) + measurable results (30% deployment speed, 1M+ records, 5× faster feedback loops, 5% accuracy gain, 8% toxicity reduction, 98% satisfaction, 96% graduation, 60% time reduction) + business outcomes (faster deployments, quicker feedback loops, higher engagement, maintained satisfaction). Metric quality is high with precise percentages and counts. Minor shortcoming: the one-line summary is somewhat vague and a few metrics lack explicit timeframes, but overall the output is highly specific and business-impactful.
CredTail: Strengths: Many high-priority items in the Actual Output are explicitly supported by the Retrieval Context — exact matches include name, email, LinkedIn and GitHub URLs; employers and employment dates for Solutions Architect Intern (AWS, Jun 2025–Sep 2025), Software Developer Intern (WOPLLI, Jun 2024–Sep 2024), IT Support Intern (Mayor’s Office, Feb 2024–May 2024), and IT Instructor Assistant (RF CUNY & Generation USA, Feb 2022–Aug 2023); project “Alfred” details; education degrees, dates and GPAs; and certifications. Core technologies largely match (AWS services, Azure, ETL/ELT, Data Modeling, SageMaker, QuickSight, Python, SQL/NoSQL, CI/CD, Microservices, Security tools). Discrepancies: phone number in Actual (929-305-7353) directly contradicts Retrieval (347-491-2955) — treated as suspected fabrication (deducted 4 points). The Actual lists C++ as a core language but C++ is not present in the Retrieval Context (deducted 2 points). No degree/employer/date inconsistencies were found. Scoring: start 10, minus 4 (phone contradiction) minus 2 (unsupported C++) = final score 4. Recommendation: verify the phone number and confirm the C++ claim with source documentation; other items are supported by the Retrieval Context.",251,2025-12-18 20:28:45.435583,10,4

Tone: Professionalism is strong: clear headings, consistent tone, correct grammar, and well-organized sections (contact, summary, skills, experience, education). Action-orientation is strong: bullet points use verbs like Designed, Built, Automated, Fine-tuned and include measurable outcomes (processing 1M+ records; ~5% accuracy improvement; ~8% toxicity reduction; 36 lessons for 200+ learners). Persona alignment is excellent: content, tools, and projects (AWS Bedrock/SageMaker/Glue, FastAPI, pgvector, data pipelines) map directly to a Solutions Architect/Data Science role. No category is notably lower than the others, so there is no imbalance to flag.
Alignment: Resume explicitly satisfies core requirements (Bachelor’s degree; strong AWS, Python, SQL/relational DB, ETL/data-processing, algorithms, and large-scale infra experience) and shows measurable outcomes (1M+ record pipeline, model accuracy/toxicity improvements), but omits required full‑stack languages (PHP/C/C++/Java/C#), front‑end tech (JavaScript/HTML/CSS) and React/React Native, and lacks explicit test‑coverage or code/design‑review experience. Tally: 8 explicit + 5 implied of 16 total requirements (~65.6%), yielding a mid‑range match after a small penalty for lack of Meta‑specific/full‑stack/frontend evidence and a bonus for measurable outcomes.
Impact: Strong use of explicit action verbs (Designed, Built, Automated, Fine‑tuned, Delivered) and multiple concrete metrics (automated pipeline processing 1M+ records; model accuracy +~5% and toxicity −~8%; 36 lessons for 200+ learners; GPA 4.0) give a high base score. No other outputs were provided for relative comparison, so no comparative adjustment. Minor vagueness in phrases like “shortens feedback loops and accelerates application throughput” results in a small penalty for unquantified business impact, but clear ownership and direct outcomes (actionable sentiment insights, real‑time QuickSight dashboards) support a positive final adjustment.
CredTail: Most critical fields are verified against the Retrieval Context: personal/contact info and links (email, phone, New York location, LinkedIn, GitHub) are an exact match; employers and experience entries (Solutions Architect Intern at Amazon Web Services Jun 2025–Sep 2025; Software Developer Intern WOPLLI Jun 2024–Sep 2024; IT Support Intern Mayor’s Office Feb 2024–May 2024; IT Instructor Assistant RF CUNY & Generation USA Feb 2022–Aug 2023) match exactly with dates; education entries (M.S. expected Jan 2026, B.Tech Jun 2024) and listed honors match exactly; certifications and project (Alfred) tech (FastAPI, PostgreSQL+pgvector, OpenAI/GPT variant, Docker, CI/CD) largely match. Core technologies (Python libs, AWS services including Bedrock/SageMaker/Glue/QuickSight, Azure components, FastAPI, Docker, SQL/NoSQL) are present and consistent. Minor gaps/partials: project LLM naming differs slightly (Actual says “GPT-4 Mini” vs Retrieval’s “GPT-4.1 mini”), and a few less-prominent skills from the Retrieval Context (e.g., explicit “R Programming”, detailed “Security (SIEM, IDS)” line) are omitted in the Actual Output. No fabricated items were found. Because all key fields (degree, employers, dates, core techs) are present and consistent with only small omissions/one minor naming discrepancy, the score is high but reduced by one point for those minor inconsistencies and omissions.",274,2025-12-18 20:31:34.469861,9,9

Tone: Professionalism: 5 — resume uses a formal, polished tone with clear grammar and consistent sectioning. Action-Oriented: 5 — strong verbs and measurable achievements (e.g., built a pipeline processing over 1M feedback records, 5× faster feedback-to-action, 5% model accuracy gain, 96% cohort graduation). Persona Alignment: 4 — overall fits an early-career data/ML/cloud persona (Data Analyst/solutions-architect blend) but has slight role/targeting ambiguity between a Data Analyst summary and Solutions Architect-heavy experience. Average = (5+5+4)/3 = 4.7 → scaled to an integer score of 9. No inconsistency flagged (no two category scores differ by more than 1).
Alignment: Strengths: resume explicitly lists SQL, Python and Excel, describes developing prototypes/POCs with measurable metrics (1M records processed, 5× faster turnaround, 5% accuracy gain), and names collaboration with Global Markets Financial Risk and Model Risk Management — matching the prototype, tools and partial partnership responsibilities. Shortcomings: VBA is not listed, Global Risk Analytics (GRA) is not mentioned, there is no demonstrated Market Risk/Front Office experience or regulatory-landscape work, and most roles are AWS/IT internships rather than risk/front-office positions. Based on the weighted matching of responsibilities (partial match), tools (3 of 4), outcomes (metrics exist but aren’t tied to risk duties), and applying a penalty for being generic/misaligned to the role, the final rounded score is 2.
Impact: Strong presence of explicit, action-oriented metrics: e.g., a sentiment pipeline processing over 1M feedback records enabling a 5× faster feedback-to-action turnaround, fine-tuning models with a 5% accuracy increase, delivering 36 lessons to 200+ learners and achieving a 96% cohort graduation rate. These are clear, measurable accomplishments tied to outcomes. Points were deducted because several bullets lack quantification or business context (e.g., “reduced manual workload” and other role statements with no numeric impact) and some wording is mildly passive or lacks baseline context for the reported improvements.
CredTail: High fidelity to the retrieval context overall: the name, contact info, LinkedIn/GitHub, both degrees (MSc Data Science & ML — Expected Jan 2026, GPA 4.0; BTech Computer Information Systems — Jun 2024, GPA 3.78), internship employers and dates (AWS Jun 2025–Sep 2025; WOPLLI Jun 2024–Sep 2024; Mayor’s Office Feb 2024–May 2024; RF CUNY & Generation USA Feb 2022–Aug 2023) and many technical items (Python, SQL/NoSQL, R, Docker, Power BI/Tableau, AWS services, SageMaker, Bedrock, Glue) and certifications are directly supported in the retrieval context. Shortcomings / unsupported or inconsistent claims that caused deductions: the professional summary asserts Excel and experience with “financial markets and risk management” and collaboration with “Global Markets Financial Risk and Model Risk Management” — these specific claims do not appear in the retrieval context (unsupported/fabricated); Dean’s List is listed as “8x” in the Actual Output but the retrieval shows Dean’s List counts that do not match (Bachelor 5x, Master 2x — inconsistency); the label “MSSQL” in skills is not an exact string in the retrieval (retrieval shows MS SQL Server), and “Excel” is not listed in the core skills.

Tone: Professionalism: 4/5 — well-formatted Markdown-style resume with clear headings, contact links, concise bullets and good grammar, though a few minor consistency/details could be tightened. Action-Oriented: 5/5 — strong use of action verbs and measurable outcomes (e.g., automated workflows, refurbished 800+ devices, 100+ support tickets, 96% graduation rate). Persona Alignment: 4/5 — tone and IT-focused content align well with an IT/support technologist, but with a stated Data Science/MS in progress there is limited ML/project evidence to fully target data-science roles. Average = (4 + 5 + 4) / 3 = 4.33/5 (mapped to ~8.7/10, rounded to 9). Highest: Action-Oriented. Lowest: Professionalism and Persona Alignment (tie).
Alignment: Strengths: Resume explicitly matches many core responsibilities from the posting — Windows 10 & Active Directory support, endpoint hardware/helpdesk, troubleshooting, IT asset management, ServiceNow usage, strong customer service, and quantified results (refurbished/tracked 800 devices, handled 100+ tickets, 96% cohort graduation). Location (New York) and GPA (3.78) meet the NYC and 3.3+ requirements. Shortcomings: missing several job-specific technologies and tasks — no explicit mention of Windows Server 2012/2016/2019 administration, Microsoft Office 365/SharePoint administration, patch management systems, endpoint imaging systems, enterprise endpoint protection tools, or Microsoft Azure. Also the resume is not tailored to the company/title (ETech 7) and does not explicitly state internship availability/commitment details. Overall most core helpdesk requirements are met with strong metrics, but several key platform/administration items are absent, so points were deducted.
Impact: Strong presence of action verbs plus multiple explicit metrics and impacts (e.g., refurbished and tracked over 800 devices for redeployment; delivered white-glove support on 100+ tickets; taught 36 lessons to 200+ learners; achieved a 96% cohort graduation rate), which aligns with high-scoring criteria (specific action + numeric metric + business/educational outcome). However, several bullets lack measurable results or clear business impact (e.g., “Automated troubleshooting workflows” without quantifying reduction, “Maintained IT asset inventory,” “Supported VIP users” are vague), and a few generic/phrasings reduce clarity. Points deducted for those vague/passive items per the penalty guidance.
CredTail: Verified: personal details (name, NY location, Darwhin88@gmail.com, 347-491-2955), LinkedIn/GitHub links, IT Support Intern at Mayor’s Office of Information Services (Feb 2024–May 2024) and matching bullets, IT Instructor Assistant (Feb 2022–Aug 2023) and matching bullets, education entries (MS Data Science & ML expected Jan 2026, BS Jun 2024) with GPAs and honors, and listed certifications—these all match the Retrieval Context. Missing: key employer roles and dates from the Retrieval Context (Solutions Architect Intern — Amazon Web Services, Jun 2025–Sep 2025; Software Developer Intern — WOPLLI Technologies, Jun 2024–Sep 2024), the major project “Alfred” and its tech stack (FastAPI, PostgreSQL+pgvector, OpenAI GPT-4.1, Docker), and numerous core technologies present in the Retrieval Context but omitted from the Actual Output (AWS services such as EC2/S3/Lambda/Glue/Bedrock/SageMaker/QuickSight, SQL/NoSQL databases like PostgreSQL/MySQL/MongoDB/DynamoDB, PyTorch/R, Generative AI tooling/fine-tuning, FastAPI, Docker, etc.). Fabricated/Contradicted: none found. Scoring: initial credibility is high for the included items but multiple critical employers, a flagship project, and many core technologies are missing from the Actual Output; per the penalty rules (1 point per missing critical item) these omissions drive the score down to the minimum allowable. Final score reflects the many verified items but substantive missing critical items.",222,2025-12-18 20:02:45.156866,8,1

Tone: High professionalism: clean, well-formatted resume with correct grammar and clear sections (contact links, Summary, Core Skills, Experience, Education). High action-orientation: numerous strong action verbs and quantified outcomes (e.g., sentiment pipeline processing 1M+ records with 5× faster feedback, SageMaker tuning +5% accuracy/−8% toxicity, Alfred reduced application time by 60% and increased applications by 300%). Strong persona alignment with the target technologist/data/AI roles (AWS, SageMaker, ETL, CI/CD, MS in Data Science). Minor shortcoming: a few bullets are generic/unquantified (e.g., “Designed AWS architectures” and some integration/workflow items) but overall the output matches the evaluation criteria very well.
Alignment: Step 1 (responsibilities): Resume explicitly shows several JD responsibilities—critical: developing/modifying software (Software Developer Intern, API work), proficiency in programming/data analysis (Core Skills: Python, Java, C++, SQL; Data/ML experience), building large-scale infrastructure/apps (AWS architectures, ETL pipelines) — count: 4 critical matches. Optional: telecommute (multiple remote roles), working on moderate-scope problems and exercising judgment (intern projects) — 2 optional matches. Missing/weak: explicit statements about producing high-quality code with test coverage, mastering internal dev standards, and deep product-area/codebase ownership. Step 2 (tools): Strong exact matches for required tools: Python, Java, C++, JavaScript/HTML/CSS, SQL, PostgreSQL/MySQL, AWS, CI/CD, Docker — most must-haves present. Missing: C, C#, and PHP/Ruby (some JD language variants). Step 3 (outcomes): Resume contains several concrete metrics tied to work (1M+ records, 5× faster pipeline, +5% model accuracy, −8% toxicity, 60% time reduction, 300% increase in weekly applications, 96% graduation rate) — strong measurable impact. Scoring translation: responsibility match (~2/3), tools (~3/3), measurable outcomes (~3/3) with +1 for strong metrics, minus 1 for lack of explicit test-coverage/dev-standards/product-depth tailoring → final score assigned accordingly.
Impact: Many bullets include a clear action verb, specific measurable result, and business outcome (e.g., “Automated sentiment-analysis pipeline processing 1M+ records, achieving 5× faster feedback loops”; “Fine-tuned models…enhancing accuracy by 5% and reducing toxicity by 8%”; Alfred: “Reduced application time by 60%, boosting weekly applications by 300%”; “Delivered 36 lessons to 200+ learners, maintaining a 96% graduation rate”; “Delivered white-glove support on 100+ tickets”). Metrics are high-quality and specific (counts, percentages, multipliers), which justifies the maximum metric bonus. A small penalty applied for a few vague phrases lacking quantification (e.g., “improving scalability,” “reducing manual workload significantly”), but overall the output is active, specific, and outcome-focused, supporting a top-range normalized score.

Core technologies largely match (Python; SQL/NoSQL; AWS services including EC2, S3, Lambda, RDS; Azure; ETL/ELT; SageMaker/Bedrock references; Docker, Git, CI/CD; PostgreSQL, MySQL, MongoDB). Discrepancies: three core technologies listed in the Actual Output (C++, HTML, CSS) are not explicitly present in the Retrieval Context and were treated as unsupported (each counted as a high-priority core-tech discrepancy per the evaluation rules). No degrees, employers, or dates are missing or contradicted, and there are no suspected fabrications. Scoring rationale: started from full credibility and applied the prescribed deductions for the three unsupported core technologies (2 points each), producing the numeric score reported.

Tone: Professionalism: clear, well-structured resume with consistent tone and no grammatical issues. Action-Oriented: uses strong verbs and measurable outcomes (e.g., automated pipeline processing 1M+ records, ~5% accuracy improvement, ~8% toxicity reduction, 96% cohort graduation rate). Persona Alignment: vocabulary and emphasis strongly match Solutions Architect/Data Science roles (AWS Bedrock, SageMaker, Glue, analytics pipelines, LLMs). All three categories scored at the top end, producing the maximum overall rating and no category shows a ≥1-point deficit relative to the others.
Alignment: The resume shows explicit cloud/ML tooling and measurable outcomes (AWS services including Bedrock/SageMaker/Glue/QuickSight, Python, an automated pipeline processing 1M+ records, ~5% accuracy gain and ~8% toxicity reduction, 96% cohort graduation), and some data-driven analysis (POCs, dashboards) — but it lacks nearly all leadership requirements from the Meta listing (no multi-year roadmap, no large cross-functional or cross-company engineering leadership, no 8+ years experience, limited evidence of influencing execs or driving org-wide technical direction). Several technical prefs are partially met (Python, cloud/monitoring) but key languages (C/C++/Java) and senior-level responsibilities are absent, yielding low alignment.
Impact: Strong use of active ownership verbs (Designed, Built, Automated, Fine-tuned, Delivered) and multiple concrete metrics: automated sentiment pipeline processing 1M+ records with real-time QuickSight dashboards, model improvements (~5% accuracy, ~8% toxicity reduction), and instructional impact (36 lessons to 200+ learners with a 96% graduation rate). These outcomes tie clearly to business/operational impact and demonstrate measurable accomplishments. Minor gaps: a few bullet points (Virtual Credential System, Azure configuration) lack specific metrics, but this is a small shortcoming compared with the clear, quantified results elsewhere.
CredTail: All critical fields in the Actual Output are directly supported by the Retrieval Context: education entries (MS Data Science & ML expected Jan 2026 with GPA 4.0; BTech June 2024 with GPA 3.78 and honors) are present and match; employers and roles (Solutions Architect Intern at Amazon Web Services; Software Developer Intern at WOPLLI Technologies; IT Support Intern at Mayor’s Office of Information Services; IT Instructor Assistant at RF CUNY & Generation USA) and their dates align exactly; core technologies and skills (Python with pandas/scikit-learn/PyTorch, SQL/NoSQL, AWS services including Bedrock/Glue/SageMaker/QuickSight, Azure, Docker, Postgre/Oracle/MySQL/MongoDB/DynamoDB, etc.) mirror the Retrieval Context; certifications and interests also match.

Tone: I rated Professionalism, Action-Oriented, and Persona Alignment each slightly above average, yielding an above-average overall score. Strengths: clear, professional format and grammar; strong action verbs (e.g., Configured, Developed, Automated) and result-focused entries (96% cohort graduation rate; 100+ tickets handled); technical breadth and vocabulary match cloud/data roles (AWS services, Glue, SageMaker, SQL/NoSQL, PyTorch). Shortcomings: minor consistency/typo (""Postgre""), some bullets lack quantification or specific impact, and a bit of jargon (""agentic AI"") that could be clarified. No category is notably lower than the others, so the profile is balanced.
Alignment: Compared to the job posting requirements (React, Node.js, OAuth, Highcharts, Azure deployments, web app development, security on Azure, cross-functional collaboration, performance/scalability, troubleshooting, code reviews, Agile, bachelor’s degree, financial-services experience), the resume explicitly shows Azure experience (App Service, Functions, Storage; configured/tested Azure environments), troubleshooting (automated troubleshooting, IT support), Agile, and a bachelor’s degree, with measurable outcomes (96% cohort graduation rate; 100+ tickets). Several core required technologies—React, Node.js, OAuth, and Highcharts—and financial-services experience are absent. Multiple other responsibilities (web app development, Azure security, collaboration, optimization, code-review practices) are only implied. I applied a penalty for lack of senior-level tailoring and missing key frontend/backend/auth tooling, and a small bonus for measurable outcomes and explicit Azure use.
Impact: Strong use of action verbs (Configured, Developed, Managed, Automated, Delivered, Maintained) and multiple clear metrics (over 100 tickets supported, 36 lessons for 200+ learners, 96% cohort graduation rate, GPAs/Dean’s List) justify a high score. Some bullets lack quantified business impact (Azure configuration, vendor management, “reduced manual workload” without % or time saved), so minor vagueness penalizes slightly. No comparative outputs were provided to change the rating further.

Persona alignment is excellent for data science/ML and engineering roles given references to SageMaker, AWS, Azure, PostgreSQL, and relevant tooling. The three evaluation areas are consistent with no notable gaps between professionalism, action-focus, and role fit.
Alignment: Strengths: resume shows the required technical languages SQL and Python, plus measurable outcomes (e.g., processing 1M+ records, 5× speedup, accuracy and resolution improvements) and relevant tooling like PostgreSQL, Power BI/Tableau. Shortcomings: critical JD requirements are missing—no mention of Excel or VBA, no Market Risk/Front Office or financial markets product knowledge, no regulatory understanding, and no stated collaboration with GMFR/GRA/MRM or finance-focused prototype development. Because only partial tool overlap and outcomes are not tied to the finance/risk context, the alignment is very weak.
Impact: Many bullets contain the three required elements (action verb + measurable result + business outcome). Strong examples: automated sentiment pipeline processing 1M+ records with 5× faster feedback; fine-tuned SageMaker models improving accuracy by 5% and reducing toxicity by 8%; automated troubleshooting reducing resolution time by 30%; delivered 36 lessons to 200+ learners with a 96% graduation rate; Alfred project: 60% time reduction and 300% increase in applications. Metric quality is high (precise counts and percentages, internship timeframes). Shortcomings: several items are vague or lack metrics (e.g., “enhancing deployment efficiency,” “improving stakeholder understanding,” “analyzed learning data to tailor instruction,” “monitored security logs”), so a small clarity penalty applies.
CredTail: Evidence-based comparison to Retrieval Context: exact matches — both degrees (M.S. Data Science & Machine Learning, Expected Jan 2026, GPA 4.0; B.Tech in Computer Information Systems, Jun 2024, GPA 3.78) are explicitly present in the Retrieval Context; all four employers and employment dates (AWS Jun 2025–Sep 2025; WOPLLI Jun 2024–Sep 2024; Mayor’s Office Feb 2024–May 2024; RF CUNY & Generation USA Feb 2022–Aug 2023) are exact matches; the Alfred project details (PostgreSQL + pgvector, FastAPI, 60% time reduction / 300% increase) and AWS/SageMaker/Bedrock sentiment pipeline claims are supported. Supported core technologies: Python, SQL/NoSQL, R, Docker, Git, Power BI, AWS services, Azure, PostgreSQL, MySQL, DynamoDB, QuickSight, SageMaker, etc. Discrepancies (penalties applied): Tableau is listed in the Actual Output but is not present in the structured core_skills (−2); JavaScript appears in the Actual Output but is not clearly present in the structured core_skills (though Java is present in artifacts) (−2). No direct contradictions or suspected fabrications were found. Following the prescribed weighting (degrees/employers highest priority — all matched; core technologies high — two unsupported items penalized; dates medium — all matched), deductions were applied accordingly. Recommend verifying the Tableau and JavaScript claims against source documents if those skills are critical to evaluation.",261,2025-12-18 20:38:06.933169,10,6

Tone: High professionalism: clear, well-formatted resume with correct grammar and consistent tone (contact links, sectioning). Highly action-oriented: strong action verbs and measurable outcomes (e.g., automated sentiment pipeline processing 1M+ records, 96% cohort graduation rate, built POCs with Bedrock/Glue/Athena). Strong persona alignment for cloud/solutions-architect and data roles (AWS services, CI/CD, FastAPI, PostgreSQL, ML/AI focus). No category is ≥1 point lower than the highest, so no imbalance noted.
Alignment: Resume explicitly demonstrates backend design, Python and PHP, AWS large-scale infrastructure (1M+ records) and data-driven analysis (earned a +bonus), but is missing C++ and Hack experience, lacks explicit code/design review and component ownership, and does not meet the Master’s/3-year minimum (applied a -penalty for missing key qualifications), yielding a moderate match to the Meta requirements.
Impact: Multiple explicit action verbs and measurable results (e.g., “Automated a sentiment-analysis pipeline processing 1M+ records,” “delivered lessons for 200+ learners,” and a “96% cohort graduation rate”) justify a high base score per Step 1. Language is largely active (“Designed,” “Built,” “Automated”), but a few items are vague (e.g., “reduced manual workload” without quantification), so a small penalty was applied per Step 3. Clear ownership and business-relevant outcomes (real-time dashboards, actionable insights) earned a final positive adjustment per Step 4, yielding a high overall alignment with the evaluation criteria.
CredTail: Cross-checked fields: personal info (name, email, phone, location, LinkedIn, GitHub) are exact matches to the Retrieval Context; employers and internship dates (AWS Jun 2025–Sep 2025, WOPLLI Jun 2024–Sep 2024, Mayor’s Office Feb 2024–May 2024, RF CUNY & Generation Feb 2022–Aug 2023) are exact matches; degrees and dates (MS expected Jan 2026, BS Jun 2024) and listed certifications are exact matches. Core technologies and project details are a partial match: the Actual Output captures many AWS services and project components but omits several specific items in the Retrieval Context (Bedrock, SageMaker fine-tuning, Macie, pgvector/OpenAI GPT-4.1 mini and other listed project tech), and some experience highlights (SageMaker fine-tuning, device refurbishing, ServiceNow, CrowdStrike monitoring) are reduced or summarized. No fabricated employers, degrees, or dates were detected. Given full verification of critical identity, employment, education, and certifications but several notable omissions in core tech and some experience highlights, I applied minor penalties for incompleteness rather than fabrication; those omissions reduced the overall credibility score accordingly and explain the numeric rating.",289,2025-12-18 20:40:58.27514,9,8

Tone: All three evaluation categories scored at the top: Professionalism (5) for clear, well-formatted resume, correct grammar, and structured sections; Action-Oriented (5) for strong verbs and multiple quantified outcomes (e.g., 1M+ records, 5× faster feedback loops, 96% graduation rate, 400+ devices restored, 60% reduction/300% increase); Persona Alignment (5) for content and certifications that match a solutions-architect/technologist role (AWS skills, CI/CD, relevant projects). No notable contradictions or gaps between categories; average = 5.0.
Alignment: The resume shows some alignment (AWS, Java, MongoDB, CI/CD, Agile, and concrete metrics such as “1M+ records, 5× faster”, 96% cohort graduation, 400+ devices restored, and a 60% reduction in application time) but fails to demonstrate critical JD requirements: senior engineering leadership, 5+ years building SaaS/highly-available concurrent web apps, and explicit use of Spring Boot, ReactJS, or GitLab (VCS) are missing. Responsibility coverage is partial (design, deployment, mentoring through teaching) but lacks explicit code-review leadership and senior-level ownership. Strong measurable outcomes earn full credit in that category, while tool/tech and responsibility matches are weak-to-moderate; lack of seniority and company/job-specific tailoring warrants deduction.
Impact: The resume repeatedly includes clear action verbs (e.g., “Automated,” “Delivered,” “Restored,” “Reduced”), specific measurable results (1M+ records, 5× faster feedback loops, 36 lessons to 200+ learners, 96% graduation rate, 400+ devices restored, 60% time reduction, 300% increase in applications) and explicit business outcomes (faster feedback loops, higher graduation rate, improved operational readiness, more applications), satisfying the action+metric+outcome requirement. Metric quality is high with precise numbers/percentages, so it earns full metric points. Minor vague lines (e.g., “Designed secure, scalable AWS architectures…,” “Deployed scripts… improving response time and service quality”) lack quantification and introduce slight vagueness, so a small penalty applies. Overall the strengths (multiple strong quantified bullets tied to outcomes) justify a top evaluation under the given rubric.
CredTail: Evidence of strong alignment: AWS Solutions Architect Intern (Amazon Web Services) with matching dates (Jun 2025–Sep 2025) and matching highlights; Alfred project metrics and CI/CD details match retrieval; core backend/cloud/database skills (Python, SQL, MongoDB, MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle, AWS EC2/S3/Lambda, Azure) and certifications (AWS Solutions Architect – Associate, AWS AI Practitioner – Generative AI, Google Cybersecurity) are explicitly supported. Discrepancies (penalties applied): missing Master’s degree (CUNY SPS MS Data Science, Expected Jan 2026 appears in Retrieval but is omitted in Actual) — missing high-priority degree; omitted employer/role WOPLLI Technologies (Software Developer Intern, Jun 2024–Sep 2024) — missing employer; direct contradiction on Mayor’s Office role/dates (Actual: Feb 2024–Current, “restored 400+ devices”; Retrieval: Feb 2024–May 2024, refurbished/tracked 800+ devices) — treated as a direct contradiction/suspected fabrication; bachelor date mismatch (Actual: Expected May 2024 vs Retrieval: Jun 2024) — date inconsistency; unsupported listed technologies in Actual (JavaScript, HTML not present in Retrieval core_skills/artifacts). Applying the evaluation rules (start at full credibility, deduct for missing/contradictory degrees and employers as highest priority, tech as high, dates as medium) yields cumulative deductions that eliminate credibility relative to the Retrieval Context. Recommend source verification for the missing Master’s listing, WOPLLI employment, Mayor’s Office dates/metrics, and the claimed JavaScript/HTML skills (transcripts, offer letters, or GitHub/portfolio).",266,2025-12-18 20:41:31.948586,10,0

Tone: Professionalism is strong: clear, consistent formatting and grammar, complete contact links (email, phone, LinkedIn, GitHub), and concise summary and education entries. Action-oriented is good—uses strong verbs (Delivered, Automated, Created) and includes measurable outcomes in places (36 lessons, 200+ learners, 96% cohort graduation rate)—but several bullets (e.g., “Automated troubleshooting workflows,” “Developed comprehensive testing materials”) lack quantified impact such as time saved, error reduction, or throughput gains. Persona alignment is excellent: specific tooling, AWS services, ML frameworks (Python, PyTorch), and relevant certifications clearly match a data/AI/solutions engineering role. Overall this yields a high aggregated rating; note an imbalance where Action-Oriented scores one point lower than the other categories, so adding more concrete metrics for technical tasks would improve parity.
Alignment: Evaluated against 10 requirements from the posting, the resume matches ~85% (7 explicit: data collection/analysis through pipelines and tracking, support for data-driven decisions, tool use, relevant education, analytical and communication skills, eagerness to learn; 3 implied: reporting/visualizations, data-quality audits, team meeting participation). Strengths: explicit Python/pandas/SQL and QuickSight/Power BI skills plus a measurable 96% cohort outcome; shortcoming: not tailored to CityWonders/Data Analyst Intern role and lacks explicit reporting/audit projects, so a small tailoring penalty was applied.
Impact: Strong use of action verbs and multiple concrete metrics (Delivered 36 lessons, taught 200+ learners, maintained a 96% cohort graduation rate) supports a high score. Some statements (e.g., “Automated troubleshooting workflows…to reduce manual workload”) lack quantified impact, so minor vagueness reduces points. Active ownership is clear throughout and graduation metric ties to business/educational outcomes, justifying a top-tier rating with a small deduction for unquantified results.
CredTail: Verified exact matches: personal/contact info (name, email, phone, location, LinkedIn, GitHub), summary text, IT Instructor Assistant entry (RF CUNY & Generation USA) with matching dates/highlights, both education records (degrees, institutions, dates, GPAs, honors), and listed certifications. Partial matches: core skills largely align but Actual Output omits several Retrieval Context AWS/ML/Azure specifics (Bedrock, Macie, SageMaker, Azure items, APIs, Docker) — so core technologies are a partial match. Missing fields: two employer roles from the Retrieval Context (Solutions Architect Intern at AWS, Software Developer Intern at WOPLLI) and the “Alfred” project are absent. Fabricated/inconsistent detail: Mayor’s Office dates differ (Actual shows Feb 2024–Current vs Retrieval’s Feb 2024–May 2024) and the title is slightly altered (intern → volunteer intern). These issues (one fabricated/inaccurate date and multiple missing critical experience/project entries, plus partial core-tech coverage) substantially reduce credibility, so the score reflects verified items but penalizes the fabricated date and the missing employers/projects.",294,2025-12-18 20:43:56.05634,9,4

Tone: Professionalism 4/5: clear, well-formatted resume with correct grammar and organized sections, though header styling (all-caps name) and inconsistent detail density across bullets slightly reduce polish. Action-Oriented 5/5: strong action verbs and multiple quantified impacts (e.g., automated pipeline processing 1M+ records, 5× faster feedback loops; SageMaker tuning +5% accuracy/–8% toxicity; Alfred reduced application time 60% and increased apps 300%; 96% graduation). Persona Alignment 5/5: excellent match for cloud/ML roles (AWS, SageMaker, FastAPI, LLMs, Azure) and relevant projects/skills. Largest gap is 1 point between Professionalism and the other scores. Average = (4+5+5)/3 = 4.7/5, mapped to a 10-point scale yields a final score of 9.
Alignment: The resume shows strong measurable outcomes (e.g., processing 1M+ records, 5× faster pipeline; SageMaker fine-tuning with +5% accuracy and -8% toxicity; 60% time reduction in project), and lists relevant ML/cloud tools (Python, AWS/SageMaker, Docker, Git). However, it does not explicitly match the job’s critical responsibilities: no mention of porting ML models into a cross-platform C++ SDK, bridging Python to C++ code, or delivering high-performance inference across iOS/Android/Linux/Windows. Tool/technology gaps include missing C++, mobile (iOS/Android) SDK experience, and explicit cross-platform SDK integration. Using the evaluation rubric: responsibility matches = none of the critical JD items; tools = partial (Python/SageMaker present, but must-haves like C++ and mobile/SDK integration missing); outcomes = strong and quantifiable but not tied to the JD’s core tasks. A penalty was applied for lack of GE HealthCare/Caption Health SBU or C++/mobile-specific tailoring, yielding low overall alignment with this specific role.
Impact: Multiple bullets contain action verbs + measurable results + business outcomes (e.g., “Automated sentiment analysis…1M+ records, enabling 5× faster feedback loops”; “Fine-tuned…improving accuracy by 5% and reducing toxicity by 8%”; Alfred: “Reduced job application time by 60% and increased weekly applications by 300%”; 36 lessons to 200+ learners with 96% graduation). Metric quality is high (precise numbers/percentages) so add points. Minor vagueness remains in a few lines (“reducing manual workload significantly,” “enhancing deployment efficiency”) so apply a small penalty. Overall strong alignment with the evaluation criteria.
CredTail: Evaluation summary per steps: Degrees — Exact matches: Master of Science (Data Science & ML, Expected Jan 2026, GPA 4.0) and Bachelor of Technology (Computer Information Systems, Jun 2024, GPA 3.78) are explicitly present in the Retrieval Context. Employers & dates — Exact matches: Solutions Architect Intern at Amazon Web Services (Jun 2025–Sep 2025), Software Developer Intern at WOPLLI (Jun 2024–Sep 2024), IT Support Intern at Mayor’s Office of Information Services (Feb 2024–May 2024), IT Instructor Assistant (Feb 2022–Aug 2023) all match retrieval entries and dates.

Retrieval contains an alternate phone number in artifacts (929-305-7353) but the structured profile phone (347-491-2955) matches the Actual Output. No suspected fabrications or direct contradictions among the prioritized items (degrees, employers, dates, core technologies). Recommendation: verify the Dean’s List count and the alternate phone number artifact if needed. Based on the evaluation rules (start at maximum, deduct only for discrepancies in degrees/employers/dates/technologies or suspected fabrications), the Actual Output is fully supported by the Retrieval Context with only minor non-priority discrepancies.",271,2025-12-18 20:44:35.497376,9,10

Tone: Professionalism: clear, well-structured headings and generally correct grammar and tone, but inconsistent punctuation/period usage across bullets and minor formatting inconsistencies reduce polish. Action-Oriented: strong use of verbs (Designed, Built, Automated, Fine-tuned) and some measurable outcomes (1M+ records processed, 96% cohort graduation), but several impact statements (e.g., “improving accuracy and reducing toxicity”) lack quantification. Persona Alignment: vocabulary and emphasis strongly match a cloud/data solutions architect (AWS services, Bedrock, SageMaker, pipelines), making this the strongest area. Professionalism and Action-Oriented are each about one point lower than Persona, indicating a slight imbalance toward technical alignment over resume polish and fuller impact metrics.
Alignment: Resume aligns on key technical requirements (explicit: Python, AWS, microservices, scalable cloud services, SDLC, Bachelor’s; implied: operation/reliability, Agile, data-driven work, maintenance, Master’s in progress), yielding about 56% match (base score ≈6); penalized for missing senior/leadership experience, no Oracle-specific role, and unclear 3+ years (−2), but given +1 for clear measurable outcomes (1M+ record pipeline, QuickSight dashboards) — final score 5.
Impact: Strong use of active verbs (Designed, Built, Automated, Fine‑tuned) and multiple measurable accomplishments (sentiment pipeline processing 1M+ records; maintained a 96% cohort graduation rate; delivered lessons to 200+ learners), which satisfies the requirement for explicit actions and metrics. Shortcomings: several impact statements lack quantification or clear business outcomes (e.g., “improving accuracy and reducing toxicity” and value of QuickSight dashboards are not quantified), and some phrasing is mildly vague about business impact. Ownership is generally explicit. Overall these factors justify a high rating with a small deduction for unquantified outcomes.

Tone: The resume is highly professional: clear header and contact info, well-structured sections, and error-free grammar. It is strongly action-oriented, using active verbs and multiple quantified outcomes (e.g., automated pipeline processing 1M+ records with 5x faster feedback loops; SageMaker accuracy +5% and toxicity -8%; deployment speed +30%; manual workload -40%; 96% cohort graduation). Persona alignment is excellent for cloud/data/solutions-architect roles, listing relevant AWS services (EC2, S3, Lambda, SageMaker), data-pipeline and CI/CD experience, and an MS in Data Science in progress. The three component assessments are consistent with no notable gaps, yielding the top averaged evaluation on the requested scale.
Alignment: Responsibilities: Explicit matches include #1 Develop/test software (Software Developer Intern, projects) [critical], #3 Data analysis/programming (skills: Python, SQL, Java, JS, C#, PHP) [critical], #5 Product/infrastructure work (Solutions Architect Intern, dev roles) [optional/critical], #6 Moderate-scope problems (1M+ record pipeline) [optional], #8 Release/dev standards (CI/CD pipeline) [critical], #9 Telecommute (multiple remote roles) [optional]. Missing explicit items: code/design reviews and explicit mastery of internal dev standards/test coverage. Tools/technologies: Exact matches for PHP, Java, C#, JavaScript, SQL, React, AWS/SageMaker, CI/CD (several required tools present). Missing or not listed: C/C++, HTML/CSS explicitly, React Native, and explicit relational DB names. Outcomes: Strong, quantifiable metrics present (1M+ records, 5x faster, +5% accuracy, 8% toxicity reduction, 30% faster deployments, 40% workload reduction, 60% time reduction, 300% applications), which earns high marks. Scoring rationale: responsibility match moderate (2/3), tools match moderate (2/3), measurable outcomes strong (3/3) = 7, minus 1 for missing code-review/test-coverage specifics and limited role/company tailoring, yielding the final score.
Impact: Most bullets include an explicit action verb, measurable result, and clear business outcome (e.g., “Automated sentiment-analysis pipeline processing 1M+ records, achieving 5x faster feedback loops”; SageMaker: +5% accuracy, −8% toxicity; Azure: 30% faster deployments; troubleshooting: −40% manual workload; 96% graduation rate; 60% time reduction / 300% more applications). That satisfies step 1 at the high end. Metric quality is strong and specific across items (precise counts and percentages), earning the full metric bonus from step 2. Language is active overall, though a few items are slightly vague (summary “enhancing application throughput”, “enhancing system interoperability and efficiency” lacks quantified impact, and one API integration bullet has no metric), so a minor penalty was applied per step 3. After normalization, the output scores at the top of the range for clear, quantified, outcome-focused bullets.

Discrepancies: two core technologies listed in the Actual Output (C# and PHP) are not supported by the Retrieval Context (each treated as an unsupported technology −2 each → −4). No degree or employer/date contradictions or suspected fabrications found. Starting from 10 and deducting 4 for the two unsupported technologies yields the final score.

Tone: Professionalism scored very high for clear, well-formatted layout and good grammar (contact/header, summary, sections). Action-Oriented scored very high for multiple quantified accomplishments (e.g., “1M+ records,” “5x faster feedback loops,” “5% accuracy,” “8% toxicity,” “60% time reduction,” “300% more applications”) and strong use of action verbs. Persona Alignment scored very high because skills, roles, projects, and certifications (AWS, Generative AI, Data Science MS in progress) align well with a solutions-architect/data-science persona. Scores are consistent (no meaningful gap between categories). Average of the three 1–5 ratings = 5.0, scaled to the requested 0–10 range yields the final score.
Alignment: The resume shows measurable technical impact (e.g., 1M+ record pipeline with 5x faster feedback, SageMaker model +5% accuracy/-8% toxicity, project reduced apply time 60% and +300% applications), and exact tool/process matches for Python, AWS, and CI/CD (GitHub Actions). However it lacks explicit leadership/strategic responsibilities required by the Meta JD: no evidence of driving multi-year roadmaps, leading large cross-company efforts, staffing/prioritization influence, mentoring executive stakeholders, or experience with C/C++/Java/JavaScript (preferred). Matches are mainly at implementation/project level (internships/projects) rather than principal-level infrastructure leadership. Scoring balances strong quantifiable outcomes and some tool matches against missing senior leadership, cross-functional roadmap experience, and company-level influence.
Impact: The resume consistently uses strong action verbs with measurable results and clear business outcomes (e.g., automated pipeline processing 1M+ records with 5x faster feedback loops; fine-tuned models improving accuracy by 5% and reducing toxicity by 8%; Alfred reduced time to apply by 60% and increased weekly applications by 300%), so it meets the primary evaluation criterion. Metric quality is high (specific counts, percentages), earning the full metric bonus. I applied a minor penalty for some vague phrases that lack precise metrics or are slightly passive (e.g., “reducing manual workload significantly,” “enhancing decentralized identity ecosystems,” “ensuring timely project delivery”). After normalization and tie-break considerations for business impact and clarity, the output scores very highly.

Missing/high-priority discrepancies: multiple specific core technologies absent from the resume (treated as high-priority skill omissions) — these led to major deductions. No degrees, employers, or dates are contradicted or fabricated, and no suspected fabrications were found.

Tone: Professionalism (4/5): clear sectioning, good grammar and formal tone; minor inconsistencies in formatting (contact line styling, mixed date formats, some punctuation/spacing). Action‑Oriented (4/5): contains strong, resultable items (e.g., “Generated…from a database of 65,000+ records,” “96% cohort graduation rate,” restoring 400+ devices) but several bullets remain vague/passive and could include more measurable outcomes or impact.

Imbalance: Professionalism and Action‑Oriented are each one point lower than Persona Alignment. Overall score computed from the category averages and scaled to a 0–10 range.
Alignment: Resume explicitly demonstrates Linux experience, .NET/C# and NYC/Brooklyn ties and includes measurable outcomes (65k-record report, 96% cohort rate), but lacks C++ and embedded engineering and shows no senior/SME-level experience — match ≈50% (3 explicit, 1 implied of 7 requirements); applied a +1 for measurable outcomes/explicit .NET and −1 for ignoring senior/title specifics, yielding a mid-range score.
Impact: Multiple explicit action verbs and several measurable accomplishments (GPA 3.8; generated stock reports from 65,000+ records; participated in restoring over 400 devices; achieved a 96% cohort graduation rate) satisfy the rubric’s requirement for clear metrics and actions. Some entries use passive or vague phrasing (‘provide support,’ ‘assist,’ ‘participate in a project’) and lack explicit ownership or business-impact framing, which warrants a small penalty. Overall the results tie to operational and educational outcomes, giving the output a strong alignment with the evaluation steps.
CredTail: Verified exact matches: name, email, LinkedIn URL, institution and degree title for the bachelor. Partial matches: bachelor graduation date (Actual May 2024 vs Retrieval Jun 2024) and GPA (3.8 vs 3.78); phone number is inconsistent within the Retrieval Context (Actual 929-305-7353 appears in Artifacts but the structured profile lists 347-491-2955) so treated as partial/conflicted. Missing fields: Master’s degree (CUNY SPS MS expected Jan 2026), AWS Solutions Architect / AWS internship and WOPLLI Software Developer internship (employers/dates from Retrieval), the “Alfred” project and many core technologies emphasized in Retrieval (detailed AWS stack, FastAPI, Docker, pgvector/PG, LLM/Generative AI tooling). Fabricated/inaccurate claim: Mayor’s Office role listed as “02/2024 – Current” in Actual but Retrieval records it as Feb–May 2024 (ongoing status appears inconsistent/fabricated). Because several critical items (a graduate degree, multiple internships/employers, major core technologies and a flagship project) are missing or inconsistent and one employment end-date is fabricated, the credibility is substantially reduced. Final score reflects verified basics but multiple major omissions and one fabrication.",304,2025-12-18 20:49:59.655621,9,3
181,1205,P2,8,9,4,33,"Punctuality: The score is 0.80 because the actual output mislabels facts from the retrieval: it calls Darwhin’s Jun 2024 degree an “Expected Graduation: Jun 2024” even though the retrieval shows the Bachelor of Technology was completed in Jun 2024 with GPA 3.78 and Dean’s List (5x); it incorrectly presents the IT Support Intern role as “Feb 2024 – Current” when retrieval lists Feb 2024 to May 2024; and it understates accomplishments by saying “over 400” devices refurbished/tracked whereas retrieval reports over 800 and details (automation via Python, log/CrowdStrike monitoring, ServiceNow asset inventory) that were omitted or mischaracterized.
Tone: The resume is highly professional: clean formatting, consistent tone, and correct grammar throughout; contact, education, skills, experience, projects, and certifications are clearly presented. It includes concrete achievements (restoring 400+ devices, 96% cohort graduation, AWS certifications) which strengthen credibility. Action-orientation is present with good verbs (developed, deployed, taught) but could be more result-focused and consistently quantified across bullets (many tasks are descriptive rather than outcome/impact-driven). Persona alignment fits IT/cloud/security roles well—skills and certifications are relevant—but the inclusion of data-science libraries and broad toolsets without clearer role targeting creates a slight mismatch. Both action-oriented phrasing and role tailoring lag behind the otherwise strong professionalism, so better quantification of impact and tighter role focus would improve balance and effectiveness.
Alignment: Resume explicitly includes Linux experience (core skills, Linux workshops) and NYC location, and implies software development ability (FastAPI project); however it omits C++, .NET, and embedded-engineering experience. From seven extracted requirements there are two explicit, two implied, and three absent (~43% match, placing it in the 25–49% bracket). I applied a one-point penalty for the resume being generic/not tailored to the Sr. Software Engineer role and a one-point bonus for clear measurable outcomes (restored 400 devices, 96% cohort graduation), producing the final score.
Impact: Multiple clear metrics and actions are present (restored over 400 devices; taught 36 lessons to 200+ learners; achieved a 96% cohort graduation rate; GPA 3.78; active verbs like Developed, Planned and led, Achieved), satisfying the requirement for measurable results. Some entries use passive or vague phrasing (e.g., “Provide support,” “Assist,” “Participate”), so a minor penalty is applied. Business impact and ownership are explicit for key outcomes (device restoration, graduation rate), justifying an upward adjustment to the final score.
CredTail: Verified: personal info (name, email, phone, location, LinkedIn/GitHub), Bachelor of Technology (CUNY NYCCT) with Jun 2024 graduation, GPA 3.78 and Dean’s List, IT Instructor Assistant (RF CUNY & Generation USA) dates and highlights, Alfred project and many core skills (Python libs, SQL/NoSQL, Docker, FastAPI), and listed certifications — all match the Retrieval Context. Partial matches: AWS skillset (Actual omits Bedrock/Macie/SageMaker present in Retrieval). Missing: Master of Science (CUNY SPS) degree entry, Solutions Architect Intern (AWS) and Software Developer Intern (WOPLLI) roles from Retrieval. Fabrications/inconsistencies: Mayor’s Office role dates and scope (Actual lists Feb 2024–Current and “~400 devices restored” vs Retrieval Feb 2024–May 2024 and ~800 devices), and some AWS services omitted — these reduce credibility. Because several critical fields are missing and at least one item appears fabricated, the overall credibility is low.",309,2025-12-18 20:52:32.765174,9,3
182,1063,P4,9.333333333333334,9,6,36.333333333333336,"Punctuality: The score is 0.93 because most content aligns but there are two small contradictions: the output labels the Mayor’s Office position as a Volunteer role continuing to Present instead of an IT Support Intern from Feb 2024 to May 2024, and it claims restoring 400+ devices while the context states the Mayor’s Office refurbished and tracked over 800 devices.
Tone: Professionalism: 4 — clean, well-structured resume with clear headings and good grammar, but minor inconsistencies (e.g., occasional tense/labeling and slightly nonstandard certification naming). Action-Oriented: 5 — uses strong action verbs and many quantified accomplishments (restored 400+ devices, 30% faster troubleshooting, 1M+ records with 5x faster pipeline, 96% graduation, 60% reduced application time). Persona Alignment: 5 — tone, skills (AWS, React/Node, solutions architect experience) and project focus strongly match a solutions-focused technologist role. Largest gap is 1 point between Professionalism and the other scores; average of the three is 4.7/5, scaled to a 0–10 integer score of 9.
Alignment: Step 1 (responsibilities): Resume explicitly matches several critical JD responsibilities—Develop/test/maintain with React and Node.js (listed in Core Skills and internship bullet), create data visualizations with Highcharts (listed), optimize apps for speed/scalability and troubleshoot/debug (quantified in internship/volunteer outcomes), and ensure secure Azure deployment (Azure configuration noted). Missing/not explicit: OAuth authentication/authorization (critical), participation in code reviews and close work with product/design (optional/collaborative responsibilities). Step 2 (tools/tech): Exact matches for React, Node.js, Highcharts, and Azure; OAuth is a must-have that is absent. Step 3 (outcomes/metrics): Strong measurable results across roles (400+ devices restored, 30% faster troubleshooting, 40% UX improvement, 1M+ records 5x faster pipeline, Alfred project metrics) — good concrete impact tied to some relevant responsibilities, though not tied to OAuth or Highcharts-specific outcomes. Step 4 (scoring logic): Responsibility match is solid but incomplete (missing OAuth and some collaboration behaviors), tools match is strong except for OAuth, and measurable outcomes are excellent. Penalize for lack of company/job-tailoring (no Eliassen/financial services mention) and missing OAuth. Final score reflects these strengths and gaps.
Impact: Strong alignment with the evaluation steps: most bullets contain an action verb + measurable result + business outcome (e.g., “Restored 400+ devices… enhancing operational efficiency,” “Deployed scripts… improving troubleshooting speed by 30%,” “Automated sentiment-analysis pipeline processing 1M+ records, achieving 5x faster feedback loops,” and project metrics like 60% reduction / 300% increase). Metric quality is high with precise numbers and percentages throughout (adds positive weight). Minor shortcomings: a few outcome phrases are somewhat vague (e.g., “enhancing operational efficiency,” “improving user experience” without defined KPIs), but overall clarity and impact are strong, warranting a top score.
CredTail: Evidence-based comparison to Retrieval Context:
Exact matches: name, email, LinkedIn, location; education entries and GPAs (MSc expected Jan 2026, BTech Jun 2024); employer entries and dates for WOPLLI (Jun–Sep 2024) and AWS Solutions Architect Intern (Jun–Sep 2025) and IT Instructor (Feb 2022–Aug 2023); project “Alfred” details (OpenAI GPT-4 integration, 60% time reduction) and certifications (AWS, Google) are explicitly supported.
Partial/ambiguous: phone appears as 929-305-7353 in the Artifacts portion (Actual uses this), while Structured profile lists 347-491-2955 — supported by artifacts but inconsistent across retrieval.
Missing/unsupported (penalized): several core technologies listed in Actual (Highcharts, Visual Studio, PHP, Java, React/Node.js as grouped front-end/backend stack) are not explicitly present in the Structured core_skills/experience — treated as high-priority skill discrepancies.
Contradictions / suspected fabrication (penalized): Mayor’s Office employment end date and scope conflict — Retrieval shows IT Support Intern Feb 2024–May 2024 with ~800 devices refurbished, while Actual lists Volunteer IT Support Feb 2024–Present and “restored 400+ devices”; this is a direct contradiction in dates and counts.
Scoring logic applied per instructions: started at 10, applied a major penalty for the employer/date contradiction and further penalties for multiple unsupported core technologies (deductions per rules), yielding the numeric score below. Recommended verification: Mayor’s Office end date and device counts, and explicit confirmation of the listed technologies (React/Node.js, Java, PHP, Highcharts, Visual Studio) against source documents or the candidate.",286,2025-12-18 20:52:39.944849,10,2
183,470,P2,10,10,6,42,"Punctuality: The score is 1.00 because the Contradictions list is empty, indicating no inconsistencies between the actual output and the retrieval context — well done.
Tone: Professionalism 5/5 — resume is formal, well-structured, and grammatically clean with consistent sectioning and clear contact/project formatting. Action-Oriented 5/5 — uses strong verbs (Designed, Built, Automated, Fine-tuned) and includes measurable outcomes (processed 1M+ records, ~5% accuracy gain, ~8% toxicity reduction, 96% cohort graduation). Persona Alignment 5/5 — content and vocabulary strongly match Solutions Architect/Data Science roles (AWS services, Bedrock/SageMaker, RAG, CI/CD, relevant certifications). No category is ≥1 point lower than the highest, so no imbalance flagged.
Alignment: Requirements: data architecture, data modeling, expert SQL, Python, AWS (Glue), Snowflake, data-engineering design patterns, asset-management/financial domain experience, and lead/enterprise platform leadership. Resume explicit: SQL, Python, AWS Glue (and measurable outcomes: 1M+ record pipeline, +5% accuracy, -8% toxicity); implied: data architecture/modeling/design patterns via pipeline/POC work; absent: Snowflake, asset-management/alternatives/financial domain, and senior/lead data-engineer/platform leadership. Match computes to about half of requirements met, earning a mid-range base score; a +1 bonus is applied for clear measurable outcomes and explicit Glue usage, and a -1 penalty for lack of senior/title/domain tailoring. Final rationale: strong AWS and pipeline experience but missing Snowflake, financial-domain background, and lead-level enterprise data-platform evidence.
Impact: Strong use of active ownership verbs (Automated, Built, Fine-tuned, Delivered) and multiple concrete metrics: a pipeline processing 1M+ records, ~5% accuracy improvement and ~8% toxicity reduction, 36 lessons for 200+ learners, and a 96% cohort graduation rate. These demonstrate measurable results and technical impact. Minor shortcomings: a few bullets are somewhat vague about direct business outcomes (e.g., “Designed and presented secure, scalable AWS architectures” and POC impact not fully quantified), so a small penalty was applied for limited business-outcome detail.
CredTail: High fidelity overall: contact info, LinkedIn/GitHub, degrees (MSc Data Science & ML expected Jan 2026, GPA 4.0; B.Tech CIS Jun 2024, GPA 3.78), AWS Solutions Architect intern (AWS) with matching dates (Jun 2025–Sep 2025), IT Support Intern (Mayor’s Office) and IT Instructor Assistant entries, project (Alfred) and most technical skills (AWS services, SageMaker, Bedrock, FastAPI, PostgreSQL+pgvector, Docker) are exact matches to the Retrieval Context. Missing or partial items: the Software Developer Intern role at WOPLLI Technologies (Jun 2024–Sep 2024) from the Retrieval Context is omitted (missing employer), one certification (Google Information Support Certificate) is not listed in the Actual Output (missing), and some core technologies present in the Retrieval Context (Macie and explicit Azure services) are not included in the Actual Output (partial match). No fabricated details detected. These omissions justify a moderate deduction from perfect alignment, resulting in this score.",314,2025-12-18 20:55:04.743468,9,7

Tone: Professionalism: 5/5 — very polished formatting, clear headings, correct grammar, concise summary and organized sections (Contact, Summary, Skills, Experience, Projects, Education, Certifications). Action-Oriented: 5/5 — strong action verbs and multiple quantified achievements (e.g., processing 1M+ records, 5x faster feedback loops, +5% accuracy, −8% toxicity, 96% graduation rate, 60% reduction in application time, 300% weekly application boost). Persona Alignment: 5/5 — content closely matches cloud/ML/solutions-architect persona (AWS, SageMaker, FastAPI, CI/CD, relevant certifications). Scores are consistent (largest gap 0); average = 5.0.
Alignment: Responsibility match: Resume explicitly shows designing backend/AWS architectures (critical), coding in PHP, Python, and C++ (critical), and work improving scalability/efficiency (critical). It does not show Hack, conducting design/code reviews, owning a specific component/feature end-to-end, or clear evidence of interfacing across teams (these are critical and missing or not explicit). I count ~3 critical responsibilities matched, 4+ missing/partial. Tools/technologies: Exact matches for PHP, Python, C++, AWS, CI/CD and Docker are present; Hack is missing (must-have). Outcomes/metrics: Strong quantifiable results (1M+ records, 5x faster pipeline, 5% accuracy gain, 8% toxicity reduction, 60% time reduction on project) which favorably demonstrate impact. Shortcomings: Candidate lacks the required Master’s (in-progress) and three years of relevant experience (roles are internships), and several required responsibilities (code reviews, ownership) are absent. Given ~good tools and metrics but missing key required qualifications and responsibilities, the score reflects moderate alignment.
Impact: The output consistently uses action verbs with measurable results and business outcomes in multiple bullets (e.g., “Automated sentiment-analysis pipeline, processing 1M+ records, achieving 5x faster feedback loops”; “Fine-tuned models in SageMaker, improving accuracy by 5% and reducing toxicity by 8%”; “Reduced application time by 60%, boosting weekly applications by 300%”; “Delivered 36 lessons to 200+ learners, achieving a 96% graduation rate”), satisfying the action+metric+outcome criteria across the resume. Metrics are specific and precise (counts, percentages, multipliers), earning full metric-quality points. There are minor issues with a few vague phrases (“reducing manual workload significantly,” “improving scalability” without quantification), which justify a small clarity penalty, but overall the content is active, quantifiable, and business-focused, aligning strongly with the evaluation steps.
CredTail: Strong alignment overall: personal/contact info (Darwhin Gomez, Darwhin88@gmail.com, 347-491-2955, LinkedIn/GitHub URLs) and major experiences (Solutions Architect Intern at AWS, Arlington Jun 2025–Sep 2025; Software Developer Intern WOPLLI Jun 2024–Sep 2024; IT Support Intern Mayor’s Office Feb 2024–May 2024; IT Instructor Assistant RF CUNY & Generation USA Feb 2022–Aug 2023) exactly match the Retrieval Context. Education (MSc expected Jan 2026 with 4.0; B.Tech Jun 2024, GPA 3.78, Dean’s List) and certifications also align. Project (“Alfred” FastAPI/OpenAI + CI/CD, 60% time reduction) and AWS/Azure/SageMaker details are supported. Discrepancies: two core technologies listed in the Actual Output (PHP and C++) are not present in the Retrieval Context (unsupported items = 2; treated as high-priority skill discrepancies). No degrees or employers are missing or contradicted; no suspected fabrications found. Scoring: start 10, deduct 2 points per unsupported technology (−4) => final score 6. Recommend source verification for the two unsupported technologies (PHP, C++).",291,2025-12-18 20:55:07.422756,10,6

Tone: Professionalism 5/5 — resume is formal, grammatically correct, and consistently toned with clear headings and bullet points. Action-Oriented 5/5 — uses strong verbs and measurable outcomes (e.g., automated pipeline processing 1M+ records, 5× faster feedback loops, ~5% accuracy gain, ~8% toxicity reduction, 96% cohort graduation). Persona Alignment 5/5 — vocabulary, services, and emphasis (AWS: Bedrock, Glue, Athena, SageMaker; generative AI; architecture and data-pipelines) closely match a solutions-architect/ML persona. Average computed from the three categories is maximal and there are no categories ≥1 point lower than the highest score, so no imbalance flagged.
Alignment: Extracted 8 key requirements from the job (Python, modern architectural patterns, scalable systems, performance optimization, machine learning, vector databases, senior-level experience, NY location). Resume explicitly matches Python, microservices/architectures, scalable AWS designs, performance improvements (1M+ records, 5× faster), ML/LLMs (SageMaker/Bedrock/fine-tuning), and NY location = 6 explicit matches (vector DBs and senior title absent) → 75% match mapped to the 8–9 band (mapped to 8). Applied a +1 bonus for clear measurable outcomes and explicit tool use and a −1 penalty for not matching the senior-level requirement/targeted role, yielding a final score of 8.
Impact: The output shows strong use of active ownership verbs (e.g., Designed, Built, Automated, Fine‑tuned) and multiple concrete metrics: an automated sentiment pipeline processing 1M+ records, 5× faster feedback loops, model accuracy improvement (~5%) and toxicity reduction (~8%), 36 lessons for 200+ learners with a 96% graduation rate, plus GPA and certification details. These results tie to clear business/operational impact and ownership is explicit. A few routine bullets (some internship lines, skill list) lack quantification, but overall the accomplishments are well‑measured and impactful.
CredTail: All critical fields are consistent with the Retrieval Context: personal info (name, email, phone, LinkedIn, GitHub, location) match the structured profile; summary text matches; core technologies are corroborated (Python with pandas/Scikit/PyTorch, SQL/NoSQL, AWS services including Bedrock/Glue/SageMaker/QuickSight, Azure, FastAPI, Docker, etc.); experience entries and dates align exactly (AWS Solutions Architect Intern Jun 2025–Sep 2025; WOPLLI Software Developer Intern Jun 2024–Sep 2024; Mayor’s Office IT Support Feb 2024–May 2024; IT Instructor Feb 2022–Aug 2023); education entries and dates match (MS expected Jan 2026; B.Tech Jun 2024); certifications listed are present. No fabricated items were found and no critical fields are missing; only minor cosmetic/typo differences in the core-skills list and an alternate phone number appears separately in the artifacts but does not conflict with the structured profile.

Tone: The resume is highly professional: clean formatting, clear headers, correct grammar, and concise summary and sections. It is strongly action-oriented with prominent action verbs and measurable outcomes (e.g., automated sentiment pipeline processing 1M+ records and achieving 5× faster feedback loops; SageMaker tuning improving accuracy ~5% and reducing toxicity ~8%; delivered 36 lessons to 200+ learners with a 96% cohort graduation rate). Persona alignment is excellent for solutions/data roles (AWS services, SageMaker, Python, SQL, visualization tools and relevant certifications). The three evaluation dimensions are consistent with no meaningful gaps—professional tone, quantified accomplishments, and role-relevant focus—so it merits the highest assessment on the provided scales.
Alignment: Score reflects partial but solid alignment with the Data Analyst Intern JD. Responsibilities: the resume explicitly demonstrates data collection/analysis and pipeline work (critical) and evidence of supporting data-driven outcomes (critical) via Python/SQL projects, but it lacks explicit statements about creating/maintaining reports or performing regular data quality audits and does not call out participating in team meetings. Tools: strong match — Python (pandas), SQL, R, Power BI, QuickSight, and AWS are all listed, so no obvious must-have tools missing. Outcomes: good measurable results (1M+ records processed, 5× faster feedback loops, ~5% accuracy gain, ~8% toxicity reduction, 96% cohort graduation rate) which reward concrete metrics. Deductions: resume is not tailored to CityWonders (no company-specific or internship-focused framing) and some claims are generic (e.g., “reduced manual workload significantly”). Combining responsibility, tool, and outcome scores and subtracting for lack of tailoring yields this score.
Impact: Multiple bullets include clear action verbs, measurable results, and business outcomes (e.g., “Automated sentiment-analysis pipeline processing 1M+ records, achieving 5× faster feedback loops”; “Fine-tuned models… improving accuracy by ~5% and reducing toxicity by ~8%”; “Delivered 36 lessons to 200+ learners, achieving a 96% cohort graduation rate”), satisfying the triplet required by step 1. Metric quality is high (precise counts and percentages), earning the highest metric adjustment. Minor shortcomings: several lines lack hard metrics or use vague phrasing (“reducing manual workload significantly,” “enhancing service quality and efficiency,” “Developed a database to track…”), which warrants a small clarity penalty. Overall alignment with the evaluation steps is strong and results in a top-range evaluation.
CredTail: Starting from 10: deduct 4 for a direct contradiction (phone number) and deduct 2 for a missing employer (WOPLLI Technologies), yielding a final score of 4. Evidence: Exact matches — name, email, LinkedIn URL, location, Solutions Architect Intern at AWS (Jun 2025–Sep 2025) and its highlights, IT Support Intern at Mayor’s Office (Feb 2024–May 2024) and highlights, IT Instructor Assistant (Feb 2022–Aug 2023) and highlights, both degrees and dates (Master’s expected Jan 2026; B.Tech Jun 2024) with GPAs/honors, listed certifications, and core technologies in the Actual Output (Python/pandas/scikit-learn, SQL, R, QuickSight, Power BI, AWS EC2/S3/Lambda/Glue, Git, Docker, regression/classification/ML) are all supported by the Retrieval Context. Missing fields — Software Developer Intern at WOPLLI Technologies (Jun 2024–Sep 2024) appears in the Retrieval Context but is omitted from the Actual Output (penalized as a missing employer). Suspected fabrication/contradiction — phone number differs (Actual: 929-305-7353 vs Retrieval: 347-491-2955) and was penalized as a direct contradiction.

Tone: Professionalism: strong — clear, formal tone with good grammar and consistent resume structure. Action-Oriented: very strong — frequent action verbs (Designed, Built, Automated, Fine-tuned) and concrete metrics (1M+ records, 5× faster feedback loops, ~5% accuracy improvement, ~8% toxicity reduction, 96% cohort graduation). Persona Alignment: excellent — content and tooling map closely to Solutions Architect/ML/AI roles (AWS services including Bedrock and SageMaker, ETL/Glue, FastAPI, PostgreSQL+pgvector, RAG). No category falls one point or more below the highest; only minor nitpicks (e.g., terse database name “Postgre”) that don’t materially affect the assessment.
Alignment: Computed match = 87.5% (7 of 8 job requirements present). Resume explicitly demonstrates Python, scalable AWS architectures and modern patterns (microservices), performance optimization (automated pipeline processing 1M+ records, 5× faster), machine learning (PyTorch, SageMaker, fine-tuning) and vector DB usage (pgvector), plus location in New York and measurable outcomes. Shortcoming: lacks senior-level/senior title and extensive full-time senior experience (primarily internship roles). Applied a small bonus for clear metrics and tool usage and a penalty for the seniority gap.
Impact: Strong presence of explicit action verbs and multiple measurable results (e.g., automated sentiment pipeline processing 1M+ records with 5× faster feedback loops; fine-tuned models improving accuracy ~5% and reducing toxicity ~8%; delivered 36 lessons to 200+ learners with a 96% graduation rate) meets the highest-tier metric criteria. Ownership language is active across bullets (“Designed,” “Built,” “Automated,” “Fine-tuned”), so base score is high. Minor vagueness in a few entries (e.g., Azure configuration and Virtual Credential System lacking quantified outcomes) warranted a small penalty, but clear business impact and attribution justify a top-tier final score.
CredTail: Most key fields are verified against the Retrieval Context: name, email, LinkedIn, location, phone (matches structured profile), summary, experience entries and dates (AWS Solutions Architect Intern Jun 2025–Sep 2025; WOPLLI Jun 2024–Sep 2024; Mayor’s Office Feb 2024–May 2024; RF CUNY & Generation USA Feb 2022–Aug 2023), projects, degrees (M.S. expected Jan 2026; B.Tech Jun 2024) and certifications all match. Core technologies largely match (Python, AWS services including Bedrock/SageMaker/Glue/QuickSight, PostgreSQL/pgvector, FastAPI, Docker, ML toolset). Shortcomings: Azure (listed in Retrieval Context core_skills) is omitted from the Actual Output core-skills list, Google Generative AI / GPT-4.1 mention in the project tech is reduced to “GPT-4 Mini” (partial mismatch), and a few experience highlights from the Retrieval Context (vendor relations, device refurbishment) are omitted (partial matches). No fabricated items were found in the Actual Output. Given complete verification of degrees, employers and dates and only minor omissions/partial mismatches in core tech and highlights, the credibility is high but not perfect, resulting in the score.",324,2025-12-18 21:00:02.493947,9,8

Tone: High professionalism: clean, well-organized formatting, correct grammar, and clear sections (Summary, Core Skills, Experience, Projects, Education, Certifications). Strong action-orientation: uses active verbs and quantified achievements throughout (e.g., “enhancing application throughput by 300%,” “automated sentiment-analysis pipeline processing 1M+ records,” “5× faster feedback loops,” “accuracy +5% / toxicity -8%,” “deployment efficiency +30%,” “reduced manual workload by 40%,” “reduced application time by 60%”). Excellent persona alignment for an AWS/solutions-architect/data-science role: relevant AWS services (EC2, S3, Lambda, Glue, SageMaker), CI/CD, ML project, and targeted certifications. Minor shortcoming: a few metrics lack baseline/context (scope of “enterprise clients,” exact timeframes for impact), but overall the output strongly meets the evaluation criteria.
Alignment: Responsibility match: Resume explicitly demonstrates architecting/designing cloud architectures, microservices, and building scalable data pipelines (critical) and shows SDLC/product work (optional) — roughly 3 of 6 JD responsibilities have clear matches; leadership/mentorship and explicit operational ownership are not shown. Tools/tech: Strong exact matches for required languages and cloud tooling (Python, Java, SQL/NoSQL, AWS services EC2/S3/Lambda/Glue/DynamoDB, Azure services, CI/CD); missing key JD-preferred items such as Oracle Cloud/OCI and IDEs (Eclipse/IntelliJ). Outcomes/metrics: Multiple concrete metrics are provided (300% throughput, 1M+ records with 5× faster feedback loops, +5% accuracy/−8% toxicity, 30% deployment efficiency, 60% reduced application time) — strong measurable impact. Scoring rationale: moderate responsibility alignment (2/3), good tools coverage but missing OCI (2/3), excellent measurable outcomes (3/3), no exceptional company-specific tailoring (+0), minus two points for junior/intern-heavy roles and some generic summary language. Final score reflects these strengths and weaknesses.
Impact: The resume consistently contains action verbs paired with measurable results and clear business outcomes across multiple bullets (e.g., “Automated sentiment-analysis pipeline processing 1M+ records, achieving 5× faster feedback loops”; “Fine-tuned models… increasing accuracy by 5% and reducing toxicity by 8%”; “Configured Azure environments, improving deployment efficiency by 30%”; project: “Reduced application time by 60%”). Metric quality is strong with many precise counts and percentages (1M+, 5×, 5%, 8%, 30%, 40%, 96%, 60%). Minor weaknesses: occasional vague phrasing (e.g., “achieving excellent service reviews”) and a few metrics lack an explicit timeframe. Given the prevalence of complete action+metric+outcome statements and high-quality metrics, the output warrants the top score range.
CredTail: Started at 10, deducted 2 for one unsupported core technology (Java) in the Actual Output that is not listed in the Retrieval Context. Strong matches: degrees (MS expected Jan 2026, GPA 4.0; B.Tech Jun 2024, GPA 3.78, Dean’s List 5x), employers and dates (AWS Solutions Architect Intern Jun 2025–Sep 2025; WOPLLI Jun 2024–Sep 2024; Mayor’s Office Feb 2024–May 2024; RF CUNY & Generation Feb 2022–Aug 2023), projects (Alfred with GPT-4.1/OpenAI integration), AWS/Azure skills (EC2, S3, Lambda, Glue, DynamoDB; App Service, Functions), data viz (QuickSight, Power BI), and listed certifications — all explicitly supported by the Retrieval Context. Partial/supporting inconsistency: the resume’s “300% application throughput” phrasing is supported by the Alfred project’s “boosted weekly applications by 300%” but differs slightly in wording (recommend verifying the exact metric/context). Missing/unsupported item: Java appears in Core Skills in Actual Output but is not present in the Retrieval Context (recommend source verification). No suspected fabrications or direct contradictions found. Final credibility score reflects one high-priority core-technology discrepancy.",301,2025-12-18 21:01:18.459938,10,8

Tone: Strong fit for a solutions-architect / data role: clear, consistent tone and grammar; specific tech and domain alignment (AWS services like Bedrock, SageMaker, Glue, QuickSight; agentic AI tooling; automated pipelines) and measurable items (1M+ records processed, 200+ learners, 4.0 GPA). Uses action verbs (Designed, Built, Automated, Fine-tuned) and role-appropriate vocabulary. Shortcomings: some bullets are generic or lack outcome metrics (e.g., “Developed API integration” and several Azure/Dev bullets), and there are small copy issues (""Postgre"" instead of PostgreSQL, minor punctuation/inconsistency). Relative imbalance: Persona Alignment is strongest while Professionalism and Action-Oriented are each one point lower, indicating room to add clearer impact metrics and tighten wording.
Alignment: Calculated ~57% match: resume explicitly covers many technical requirements (Python, extensive AWS services including SageMaker/Bedrock/Glue, APIs/FastAPI/Postman, microservices, ETL pipeline processing 1M+ records, and a Bachelor’s degree) but misses several product-engineering specifics (no custom UI/front-end work, limited leadership/ownership evidence, lacks 6+ years experience and C/Java/Swift/Kotlin exposure). Applied a -1 penalty for not addressing product/leadership/company-specific responsibilities and +1 bonus for measurable outcomes/tools, resulting in a final score of 6.
Impact: Strong use of action verbs (e.g., Designed, Built, Automated, Fine‑tuned) and several concrete metrics (sentiment pipeline processing 1M+ records, GPAs, teaching 200+ learners, QuickSight dashboards) justify a high base rating per step 1. Shortcomings: several business impacts are unquantified or vague (""improving accuracy and reducing toxicity"" with no % or baseline, ""reduced manual workload"" without time/effort saved, many architecture/design outcomes lack measurable results), which triggers a penalty for lack of quantified ownership. Final small positive adjustment for clear ownership and direct business‑facing results (real‑time dashboards, production‑scale pipeline).
CredTail: Verified exact matches: name, email, location, LinkedIn and GitHub URLs, summary text, experience titles/companies/locations and dates (AWS Jun 2025–Sep 2025; WOPLLI Jun 2024–Sep 2024; Mayor’s Office Feb 2024–May 2024; RF CUNY & Generation Feb 2022–Aug 2023), education entries and dates (MS expected Jan 2026; BS Jun 2024), and certifications list. Partial matches: core technologies largely align (Python, Pandas/ML libs, AWS services including Bedrock/Glue/QuickSight/SageMaker, Azure, databases) but omit some explicit items from the retrieval (explicit “Generative AI” label, Power BI, R Programming and several listed analytics/algorithm items) and some numeric model metrics present in the retrieval are not reproduced. Fabricated/mismatch: phone number is inconsistent with the retrieval (Actual Output lists 929-305-7353 vs retrieval 347-491-2955) — a fabricated critical contact field that triggers a substantial penalty. Given broad consistency across employers, dates, education and most core techs but a single fabricated contact and a few partial omissions, the score reflects a mostly accurate profile with a significant fabrication penalty.",329,2025-12-18 21:03:29.296164,8,6
190,1194,P4,7.199999999999999,9,7,33.2,"Punctuality: The score is 0.72 because the actual output contains multiple specific contradictions with the retrieval: mismatched phone numbers (structured profile lists 347-491-2955 while artifacts show 929-305-7353); overstated/incorrect skills (the profile summary claims Linux, C++, and .NET expertise though Linux appears only under Security and C++/.NET are not in core skills; Java/.NET appear only in artifacts; Windows is not listed in core skills); incorrect role title and dates (retrieval shows IT Support Intern at Mayor’s Office of Information Services Feb–May 2024, not 'Volunteer IT Support and Development Intern' or 'Current'); wrong device count (retrieval says refurbishing/tracking over 800 devices, not restoring 400+); and minor degree/GPA errors (retrieval: B.Tech in CIS, Jun 2024, GPA 3.78; output: GPA 3.8 and expected graduation May 2024).
Tone: Professionalism rated as 4/5: clear, well-formatted resume with good grammar and a strong summary, though minor formatting oddities (all-caps name, markdown link) and a timeline inconsistency (expected graduation May 2024 vs AWS internship in 2025). Action-Oriented rated 5/5: many strong action verbs and quantified results (e.g., 1M+ records, 5x faster, 96% graduation, 60% time reduction). Persona Alignment rated 4/5: tone, skills, and accomplishments match a solutions-focused technologist, but could include more architecture-specific impact (cost/scale metrics, design decisions). The largest gap is one point between Action-Oriented and the other dimensions, yielding an average of 4.3/5 overall.
Alignment: Resume explicitly lists key technologies and responsibilities: Linux systems, C++, and .NET are present (critical matches), and it shows experience developing/supporting software (projects, CI/CD). It lacks any explicit embedded-engineering experience or a clear “Subject Matter Expert” title (critical omission). Tools/tech stack matches include AWS, Docker, CI/CD, Azure in addition to C++/.NET/Linux; embedded toolchains/platforms are missing. Outcomes are strong and quantified (e.g., 1M+ records processed with 5x faster feedback, 5% accuracy gain, 400+ devices restored, 96% graduation, Alfred: 60% time reduction), which earns full credit for measurable impact. Some generic language and absence of explicit embedded/SME tailoring warrant a small deduction. Overall score reflects solid tech and metric alignment but missing embedded specialization.
Impact: Most bullets contain an action verb, a measurable result, and a clear business outcome (e.g., automated pipeline processing 1M+ records with 5x faster feedback loops; SageMaker tuning +5% accuracy/−8% toxicity; 36 lessons to 200+ learners with 96% graduation; restored 400+ devices; Alfred reduced application time 60% and increased weekly applications 300%). Metric quality is high (specific counts and percentages). Minor shortcoming: a few lines use vague phrasing (e.g., “enhancing troubleshooting capabilities” and “enhancing student engagement”) without quantification, so a small penalty was applied.
CredTail: Supporting evidence (exact matches): Solutions Architect Intern at AWS (Jun 2025–Sep 2025), IT Instructor Assistant (Feb 2022–Aug 2023), Alfred project claims (60% time reduction, CI/CD), core technologies present in Retrieval Context that appear in Actual Output (AWS, Azure, Docker, CI/CD, Python, .NET, SQL, SIEM, Active Directory, Linux), LinkedIn URL and email. Partial matches: Bachelor’s degree (same program/institution) with GPA close to Retrieval (3.8 vs 3.78). Discrepancies (penalties applied per evaluation rules): missing degree (Retrieval lists a Master of Science — omitted in Actual) → -2; missing employer/role (Software Developer Intern, WOPLLI Technologies in Retrieval — omitted in Actual) → -2; unsupported/added core technologies in Actual (C++ listed but not present in Structured core_skills) → -2; unsupported system claim (Windows listed in Actual but not in Retrieval core_skills) → -2; date discrepancy for Bachelor’s graduation (Actual: Expected May 2024 vs Retrieval: Jun 2024) → -2; suspected fabrication/direct contradiction for Mayor’s Office role (Actual lists Feb 2024–Current and “restored 400+ devices” vs Retrieval shows Feb 2024–May 2024 and ~800 devices) → -4. Rationale and recommendation: high-priority items (degrees, employers, and the Mayor’s Office date/device contradiction) drove the largest deductions. Recommend verifying the omitted Master’s degree, the WOPLLI internship, the Mayor’s Office current status and device counts/dates, and confirmation of C++/Windows proficiency before trusting the unsupported claims.",306,2025-12-18 21:04:55.0828,10,0
191,1068,P2,10,9,6,41,"Punctuality: The score is 1.00 because the contradictions list is empty, indicating there are no contradictions and the actual output fully aligns with the retrieval context—well done and accurate!
Tone: Strong persona fit and action orientation: the resume targets cloud/data roles with specific AWS/Bedrock/SageMaker skills and result-focused bullets (e.g., “Automated a sentiment-analysis pipeline processing 1M+ records,” “Delivered 36 lessons for 200+ learners,” GPA 4.0). Action verbs and measurable outcomes are frequent and relevant. Professionalism is high overall (clear sections, consistent headings), but slightly lower due to minor inconsistencies in phrasing and punctuation and a few vague claims (e.g., “improving accuracy and reducing toxicity” without numeric improvement). Because Professionalism is one point lower than the highest category, there is a mild imbalance to address. Overall alignment score reflects these strengths and the single minor shortcoming.
Alignment: Evaluated 19 core requirements from the Meta Systems posting: resume meets 8 explicitly (Python, SQL/NoSQL, Git, Linux, AWS, scalable pipelines, data processing/ML) and 7 more are implied (feature delivery, independent work, SDLC/CI-CD, distributed microservices, telecommuting), with 4 absent (OS-level/compilers/network-distribution software, Facebook-specific dev standards, feedback/process alignment, core web tech HTML/CSS/JS) → ~60% match. Strengths include explicit use of required tools and measurable outcomes (1M+ record pipeline, SageMaker fine-tuning), but it lacks systems/OS-level engineering and web/test-coverage evidence; I applied a small positive adjustment for measurable outcomes/explicit tools and a small penalty for role mismatch/omitted systems-level skills, producing the final assessment.
Impact: Assigned a mid‑high rating because the resume uses strong action verbs (designed, built, automated, fine‑tuned) and includes concrete metrics (automated pipeline processing 1M+ records; delivered 36 lessons to 200+ learners; GPA details). It lacks quantified outcome measures tied to business impact (no percentages, dollar or time savings; “improving accuracy and reducing toxicity” is unquantified), so I applied a penalty for vagueness. Some business impact is implied (actionable sentiment insights, real‑time QuickSight dashboards) which justified a small positive adjustment for ownership and impact clarity.
CredTail: High fidelity to the Retrieval Context: name, contact info (email, phone), location, LinkedIn/GitHub links, summary, all four employers and job titles, and all listed dates match exactly; both degrees and their dates/honors (Master expected Jan 2026; B.Tech Jun 2024) and certifications are present. Core technologies largely match (Python, SQL/NoSQL, AWS services including Bedrock/SageMaker/Glue/QuickSight, FastAPI, Postman, DynamoDB, QuickSight, etc.), though a few items from the Retrieval Context are omitted or shown as partial matches (specific performance metrics in AWS highlights such as “5× faster” and the ~5%/~8% model changes are omitted; R Programming and explicit Docker/containerization entries present in the Retrieval Context are missing from the Actual Output). No fabricated facts were introduced. Because all critical fields (degree, employer, dates, core tech) are verified with only minor omissions, the score is reduced slightly for partial/missing core-tech details and omitted metric specifics.",334,2025-12-18 21:06:58.838597,7,9
192,1205,P4,8.571428571428571,10,4,32.57142857142857,"Punctuality: The score is 0.86 because the claim contradicts the retrieval context in several specific ways: the phone number shown in the claim (929-305-7353) conflicts with the Structured Profile number (347-491-2955) even though the Artifacts section lists 929-305-7353; the Mayor’s Office IT Support internship is listed in the context as Feb 2024–May 2024 not “Feb 2024–Present”; the context reports refurbishing/tracking over 800 devices while the claim says “Restored 400+ devices”; and the context lists the Bachelor’s graduation as Jun 2024 while the claim states “Expected May 2024.”
Tone: Professionalism: very high—clean, well-formatted resume with correct grammar and clear sections (header, summary, skills, experience, projects, education). Action-oriented: strong use of action verbs and quantified accomplishments throughout (e.g., restored 400+ devices; automated workflows reducing manual workload by 30%; processed 1M+ records with a 5x feedback improvement; model accuracy +5%, toxicity -8%; reduced application time by 60%). Persona alignment: excellent fit for a solutions-architect/engineering persona with relevant AWS, databases, DevOps, and security skills. Minor improvement could be adding brief context for impact and chronological clarity, but overall the three component scores are consistent (5,5,5 → average 5.0, scaled to a 0–10 score).
Alignment: Resume includes required languages and related skills (explicit C++ and .NET; Linux/security listed) and strong measurable outcomes (e.g., restored 400+ devices, 30% workload reduction, 1M+ record pipeline, 5x improvement, accuracy +5%). However, it fails to demonstrate the critical responsibilities from the JD: no explicit Linux-based system development or embedded engineering experience/SME role is shown. Tools match is partial (C++/.NET present; Linux only as security, embedded toolchain/methods missing). Metrics are concrete but not tied to the core Linux/embedded responsibilities. The document also reads generic and un-tailored to a Senior Software Engineer contract role in embedded/Linux, so points were deducted for lack of role-specific evidence and tailoring.
Impact: Most bullets include an action verb, a measurable result, and a business outcome (e.g., “Restored 400+ devices…enhancing operational readiness,” “Automated troubleshooting…reducing manual workload by 30%,” AWS pipeline processing 1M+ records improving feedback loops 5x, fine-tuned models improving accuracy by 5% and reducing toxicity by 8%, Alfred reduced application time 60% and increased applications 300%). Metric quality is high with precise counts and percentages. Minor vagueness appears in a couple items (technical documentation and “improving release efficiency”) but overall language is active and outcomes are clear, so the output meets the evaluation criteria at the top range.
CredTail: Score reduced to 0 due to multiple high-priority contradictions and omissions versus the Retrieval Context. Evidence: Exact matches — AWS Solutions Architect Intern (Jun 2025–Sep 2025) and its highlights, IT Instructor Assistant (Feb 2022–Aug 2023) and metrics, Alfred project details, core cloud/databases (AWS, Azure, PostgreSQL, MySQL, Oracle, MongoDB) and certifications (AWS Solutions Architect, Google Cybersecurity) are supported. Partial matches — Bachelor of Technology at NYC College of Technology is present but date/GPA differ (Actual: Expected May 2024, GPA 3.8; Retrieval: Jun 2024, GPA 3.78). Missing fields (penalize) — Master of Science (Data Science & ML, Expected Jan 2026) is present in retrieval but omitted in Actual; WOPLLI Technologies (Software Developer Intern, Jun–Sep 2024) is absent from Actual. Contradictions/suspected fabrications (heavy penalties) — phone number: Actual lists 929-305-7353 while structured retrieval lists 347-491-2955 (artifacts also show 929-305-7353) (inconsistent); Mayor’s Office dates: Actual lists Feb 2024–Present vs Retrieval Feb 2024–May 2024; device counts differ (Actual 400+ vs Retrieval 800+). Unsupported technology claim — C++ appears in Actual but is not present in the structured skills list. Multiple high-priority discrepancies (degree omission, missing employer, date contradictions, conflicting contact) trigger large deductions under the evaluation rules; verify phone, Mayor’s Office dates and metrics, Master's degree status, WOPLLI employment, and C++ skill before trusting penalized items.",311,2025-12-18 21:08:14.101166,10,0

Tone: Overall strong alignment: clear, professional resume with relevant cloud/data skills (AWS services, Python/pandas/PyTorch, ETL/data pipelines), internships (WOPLLI, Mayor’s Office), projects (65,000+ record stock DB) and certifications. Uses solid action verbs (Designed, Configured, Automated) and contains some measurable outcomes (96% cohort graduation rate; 65,000+ records), but many bullets are descriptive rather than results-focused and there are minor formatting/consistency issues. Persona fit for cloud/data roles is excellent; professionalism and action-orientation lag slightly relative to that strength, so emphasize quantified impacts and tighten formatting to balance the profile.
Alignment: I extracted 10 core requirements (scalable pipelines; data modeling; ETL workflows; storage optimization; data warehousing; cross-functional collaboration; data engineering proficiency; mandatory global financial instruments; strong Python; ETL/tool expertise). The resume explicitly satisfies Python, ETL/tools (Glue, SSIS), data modeling, AWS pipelines and general data engineering (6 explicit), implies storage optimization, data-warehousing experience, and cross-team work (3 implied), but omits mandatory global financial instruments (absent). Match = (6 + 0.5*3)/10 = 75%, converted to a base score of 8. I subtracted 2 points for failing to address the required finance domain experience (a company-mandated qualification) and added 1 point for clear measurable outcomes and explicit use of required tools (65,000+ record stock report, 96% cohort rate, Glue/SSIS/Python). Final clamped score: 7.
Impact: Contains multiple explicit action verbs (designed, automated, developed, delivered) and several concrete metrics — 36 lessons for 200+ learners, a 96% cohort graduation rate, and generating reports from 65,000+ records — which support a high base rating. Some items (Virtual Credential System, Azure configuration, API scripts) lack measurable outcomes or clear business impact, and a few summary phrases are somewhat vague, so a small penalty was applied for limited quantified results in those bullets. Overall ownership is active and key education/project metrics tie to outcomes.
CredTail: Verified exact matches for personal info (name, email, phone, LinkedIn, GitHub, New York location), the summary, three experience entries (WOPLLI Software Dev Intern Jun 2024–Sep 2024; Mayor’s Office IT Support Feb 2024–May 2024; RF CUNY & Generation IT Instructor Assistant Feb 2022–Aug 2023), education degrees and dates (BS Jun 2024; MS expected Jan 2026), and listed certifications. Partial matches: core AWS skills present but Actual omits Bedrock, SageMaker, and Macie (present in Retrieval) and omits Azure from core-skills (though Azure appears in the WOPLLI bullets). Missing items: the Solutions Architect Intern role at Amazon Web Services (Jun 2025–Sep 2025) and the Retrieval’s Alfred agentic project are absent from the Actual Output. Fabricated items: two projects in the Actual Output (Financial Stocks Report; EZ-Rental POS) are not found in the Retrieval Context. Also honors/GPA details from Retrieval are omitted. Fabrication and the missing major AWS internship materially reduce credibility, so although many key fields are consistent, these omissions and fabricated projects substantially lower the overall trustworthiness of the Actual Output.",339,2025-12-18 21:09:49.392454,9,4

Tone: The resume is highly professional (clean formatting, correct grammar, clear sections) and uses strong, action-oriented language with multiple quantified outcomes (e.g., “Automated sentiment analysis pipeline processing 1M+ records,” “5x faster feedback loops,” “increasing accuracy by 5%,” “96% cohort graduation rate,” “Reduced job application time by 60%”). The content and technical skills (AWS, SageMaker, Glue, Lambda, CI/CD, Python, SQL) align closely with cloud/data/ML roles. No significant weaknesses noted in clarity, tone, or persona fit.
Alignment: Explicit JD matches: Python (critical), AWS/Glue and other AWS services (critical), SQL/ETL (critical, though not labeled “expert”), and data architecture (critical — resume cites AWS architecture design). Count: 4 of 9 critical JD items matched. Missing critical items: Snowflake, explicit data modeling, data engineering design patterns, domain experience in asset management/alternatives/financial services, and lead/enterprise platform ownership. Tools: Exact matches include AWS Glue, Lambda, SageMaker, QuickSight, Python, SQL/ETL; a must-have (Snowflake) is absent. Outcomes: resume contains several concrete metrics (1M+ records processed; 5x faster pipeline; +5% accuracy/-8% toxicity; 60% time reduction; 96% graduation rate) — good measurable results tied to projects/internships. Scoring per rubric: responsibility match 1/3, tools match 2/3, measurable outcomes 3/3, no +1 exceptional alignment. Subtract 2 points for lack of finance domain, missing Snowflake/leadership and limited tailoring. Final score calculated accordingly.
Impact: Strong presence of action verbs with measurable results and clear business outcomes in multiple bullets (e.g., “Automated sentiment analysis pipeline processing 1M+ records, enabling 5x faster feedback loops”; “Fine-tuned models… increasing accuracy by 5% and reducing toxicity by 8%”; “36 lessons to 200+ learners, achieving a 96% graduation rate”; “reduced job application time by 60%, increasing weekly applications by 300%”). Metric quality is high (precise counts, % changes, and timeframe implications). Minor weaknesses: several statements use vague or non-quantified phrasing (e.g., “reducing manual workload significantly,” “improving scalability and security for enterprise clients,” “enhancing system security and user experience”), which reduces clarity and warrants a modest penalty.
CredTail: Score reflects strong alignment with the Retrieval Context with one notable omission. Exact matches: personal/contact info, certifications (AWS Solutions Architect – Associate; AWS AI Practitioner – Generative AI; Google Cybersecurity Certificate), education entries and dates (MS Data Science & ML, Expected Jan 2026; B.Tech CIS, Jun 2024 and GPAs), AWS Solutions Architect Intern (AWS) with matching dates and highlights (sentiment pipeline 1M+ records, 5x faster; SageMaker fine-tuning ~5% accuracy / ~8% toxicity), IT Support Intern (Mayor’s Office) and IT Instructor Assistant entries and dates, Alfred project details, and listed cloud/ML/security/tools (Glue, Lambda, SageMaker, QuickSight, Python, SQL/NoSQL, Generative AI, SIEM, Active Directory, Docker, Git, CI/CD) are all explicitly supported by the Retrieval Context. Partial/ambiguous items: dean’s-list frequency appears as 5x in the structured profile (matches Actual Output) but an artifact line shows 8x — recommend verifying the correct count. Missing fields (penalized): the Retrieval Context includes a Software Developer Intern role at WOPLLI Technologies (Jun 2024–Sep 2024) that is absent from the Actual Output (treated as a missing employer; −2). No suspected fabrications or direct contradictions were found. Starting from 10 and deducting 2 for the missing employer yields the final score and I recommend verifying inclusion of the WOPLLI Technologies internship and confirming the dean’s-list count.",316,2025-12-18 21:11:16.231642,9,8

Tone: Professionalism: strong formal structure and clear sections (contact, summary, skills, experience, projects, education, certifications) and consistent formatting. Action-oriented: uses strong verbs (Designed, Automated, Fine-tuned, Developed) and includes measurable results (sentiment pipeline for 1M+ records with 5x faster feedback loops; SageMaker improvements of +5% accuracy and -8% toxicity; 96% graduation rate; Alfred project reduced application time by 60% and increased weekly applications by 300%). Persona alignment: content, role titles (Solutions Architect Intern at AWS, Software Developer Intern), tools (SageMaker, AWS services) and certifications (AWS Solutions Architect, Generative AI) align well with a solutions-focused AWS/ML technologist. All three dimensions are equally strong with no clear weakness or misalignment.
Alignment: Matches several core responsibilities: Python, scalable AWS architectures, FastAPI, machine learning/SageMaker and measurable outcomes (5x faster pipeline, +5% accuracy, 60% reduced app time) and location matches New York (Steps 1 & 3). Toolset comparison (Step 2) shows strong hits on Python, AWS, SageMaker, CI/CD, Docker, and ML but no explicit mention of vector databases (a stated cutting-edge requirement), lowering tool alignment. Major shortcoming under Step 4: resume reflects intern/early-career roles rather than demonstrable Senior-level experience expected for a Sr. Software Engineer, so seniority and ownership are not clearly shown. Considering strong technical alignment but missing vector DB experience and senior-level background, the overall alignment score is moderate-high.
Impact: Strong use of action verbs and multiple clear, measurable metrics tied to impact (e.g., 1M+ records and 5x faster feedback loops; fine-tuned models +5% accuracy and -8% toxicity; reduced application time by 60% and increased weekly applications by 300%; 36 lessons to 200+ learners with a 96% graduation rate). These link to productivity, model quality, and user-growth outcomes. Points deducted because several bullets remain vague or unquantified (e.g., “enhancing system functionality,” “streamlining deployment,” “reducing manual workload significantly”), and a few claims lack direct business-impact attribution.

Tone: High marks on all evaluation steps: Professionalism — clear, consistent formatting, headings, bullets, and formal tone; Action-Oriented — uses strong verbs and concrete results (e.g., “processed 1M+ records,” “improving accuracy by ~5%,” “reducing toxicity by ~8%”); Persona Alignment — content, skills (AWS, Bedrock, SageMaker), internship roles, and certifications strongly match a Solutions Architect/Data Science persona. Very minor issue: ‘Postgre’ should be ‘PostgreSQL.’
Alignment: Resume demonstrates relevant cloud and data skills: explicit AWS experience (EC2, S3, Lambda, Glue, Bedrock, SageMaker, Macie), NoSQL/DynamoDB and relational DBs (Oracle listed), REST APIs, microservices, SDLC, and a quantified project (automated sentiment pipeline processing 1M+ records with ~5% accuracy improvement and ~8% toxicity reduction). However it fails to meet core Principal/IC4 requirements: experience is internship-level (no 10+ years) and shows no senior/technical leadership or system-architect ownership; key languages from the JD (Java, GoLang, C#) are missing (resume emphasizes Python); networking protocols and mission-critical operational experience (TCP/IP, HTTP, tier-one livesite) are not explicitly shown; frontend/UX stack and tools (HTML/CSS/TypeScript, React/Vue/Angular, Figma) are omitted; distributed persistence/storage and deep performance-tuning at cloud-scale are not evidenced beyond POC work. Coverage is therefore poor and not tailored to a Principal PMTS role.
Impact: The output includes multiple clear, measurable metrics (pipeline processing 1M+ records, ~5% accuracy improvement, ~8% toxicity reduction, 36 lessons for 200+ learners, GPA 4.0) and timebound roles (internship dates), and uses active verbs — satisfying steps 1, 3 and 4. Business impact is somewhat implied via real-time dashboards and model improvements but lacks explicit revenue/cost/time-saved figures, so score is reduced slightly for limited direct business-outcome quantification.

Tone: High marks across all three evaluation steps: Professionalism is strong—clean, well-structured resume with correct grammar and polished formatting. Action-Oriented is excellent—numerous active verbs and measurable accomplishments (e.g., processing 1M+ records, 5× faster feedback loops, ~5% accuracy improvement, 96% cohort graduation rate, 60% reduction in application time). Persona Alignment is excellent—content, tone, and emphasis closely match a solutions-focused technologist with AWS, ML/agentic AI, and data engineering experience (Bedrock, SageMaker, FastAPI, pgvector, etc.). Relative strengths are uniform across categories; only minor nitpick is Markdown-style LinkedIn formatting in a plain-text resume, but no significant weaknesses.
Alignment: Checklist extraction found must-haves: Bachelor's degree, 5+ years dev (SaaS), Java, Spring Boot, ReactJS, MongoDB, AWS-hosted, GitLab/similar, industry best-practice testing, and HA/concurrent web apps. Resume matches: Bachelor's (yes); Java, MongoDB, AWS services, Git/GitHub Actions, and SDLC/Agile familiarity (explicit) — and several quantified outcomes (1M+ records pipeline, 5× faster feedback, accuracy/toxicity improvements, 96% cohort grad). Partial matches: testing/industry best practices (implied but not detailed), automation/CI-CD (present). Missing: 5+ years relevant software development, Spring Boot, ReactJS, explicit SaaS or highly-available/highly-concurrent web app experience, LMS integration, and clear senior/leadership responsibilities. I penalized for those core gaps (experience level and key tech missing) despite good metrics and tooling specifics. Overall match falls in the mid range with downward adjustment for missing must-haves and role seniority.
Impact: Strong use of action verbs and multiple measurable metrics across bullets (e.g., processing 1M+ records, 5× faster feedback loops, ~5% accuracy improvement, ~8% toxicity reduction, 36 lessons for 200+ learners, 96% graduation rate, 60% reduced time-to-apply, 100+ tickets). These give clear accomplishments and business outcomes. Shortcomings: several bullets remain vague or lack measurable outcomes (e.g., “designed and presented AWS reference architectures,” “built POCs” with no quantified impact, Virtual Credential System, vendor management, Azure configuration, and some automation claims without numbers). Occasional passive/ambiguous phrasing reduces clarity of impact. Overall good specificity but not uniformly quantified, so score is high but not perfect.
CredTail: Most critical items from the Retrieval Context are accurately reflected: name, email, LinkedIn URL, location, summary, both degrees with dates and honors (MS expected Jan 2026; B.Tech Jun 2024), experience entries (AWS, WOPLLI, Mayor’s Office, RF CUNY/Generation USA) with matching dates and key highlights (Bedrock POC, SageMaker fine-tuning, 1M+ record pipeline, QuickSight dashboards), project “Alfred” details, and listed certifications — all present and matched. Fabricated/unsupported claims: several programming languages in Core Skills (JavaScript, HTML, XML, Dart, C#, PHP) do not appear in the Retrieval Context structured profile or artifacts. Missing items from the Retrieval Context: the GitHub link (present in context but omitted in Actual Output) and some listed technologies/skills from the context (Macie, explicit R Programming and Power BI mentions, and Google Generative AI integration in the project are not reflected in the Actual Output). Note: the phone number used (929-305-7353) is present in the Retrieval Context artifacts (the structured profile also includes a different number 347-491-2955). Because core credentials, employers, dates, projects, and major cloud/AI claims align but multiple unsupported language claims and a few omitted context technologies exist, the credibility score is reduced accordingly.",263,2025-12-18 20:29:00.290472,8,7
197,1209,P4,10,10,7,45,"Punctuality: The score is 1.00 because there are no contradictions (Contradictions: []), indicating the actual output fully aligns with the retrieval context—well done!
Tone: Professionalism: document is highly professional—clean headings, clear contact info, formal tone, and concise summaries (e.g., Education, Certifications). Action-Oriented: strong use of verbs and measurable outcomes throughout (5x faster feedback loops, ~5% accuracy gain / ~8% toxicity reduction, 60% reduction in application time, 96% cohort graduation rate). Persona Alignment: content maps well to a solutions-architect/data-science persona (AWS/SageMaker experience, AWS certifications, agentic AI project ‘Alfred’, PostgreSQL, internships at AWS and municipal IT). Strengths are clarity and quantified results; no major misalignment with the target technical persona. Minor shortcoming: a few bullet points (e.g., “Designed AWS architectures”) could include more specific scope or baseline metrics for clearer impact. Overall average of the three 1–5 ratings yields a top score given the listed strengths and alignment.
Alignment: The resume aligns well with core responsibilities: it lists Python, designs scalable AWS architectures, and demonstrates ML experience (PyTorch, Scikit‑learn, SageMaker) and performance work (a sentiment pipeline with 5x faster feedback). It also includes concrete metrics (5% accuracy gain, 8% toxicity reduction, 60% time reduction, 300% application increase). Missing or weak matches: no explicit mention of vector databases (a highlighted technology) and the level is primarily internship/early‑career roles rather than clear Senior Software Engineer experience. Overall strong tool/metric matches but penalized for missing vector DBs and seniority/tailoring gaps.
Impact: Strong use of action verbs and many concrete metrics tied to outcomes (e.g., “Automated sentiment-analysis pipeline for 1M+ records, achieving 5x faster feedback loops”; SageMaker fine-tuning with ~5% accuracy gain and ~8% toxicity reduction; Alfred project with 60% reduced application time and 300% more weekly applications; 36 lessons to 200+ learners with 96% graduation; GPAs/certifications). These demonstrate measurable productivity, accuracy, and user-growth impacts. Deductions for several vague bullets that lack quantification or clear business impact (e.g., “Designed AWS architectures… enhancing scalability and security,” “Developed API integration scripts,” and some troubleshooting notes) and occasional non-specific language. Overall, multiple high-quality quantified results but not every bullet links to concrete business metrics or outcomes.
CredTail: All critical items in the Actual Output are present in the Retrieval Context. Degrees (M.S. Data Science & ML — Expected Jan 2026; B.Tech Computer Information Systems — Jun 2024) appear verbatim. All employers and titles (Solutions Architect Intern at Amazon Web Services, Software Developer Intern at WOPLLI Technologies, IT Support Intern at Mayor’s Office of Information Services, IT Instructor Assistant at RF CUNY & Generation USA) and their date ranges match the retrieval entries. Core technologies listed (Python, SQL/NoSQL, AWS services EC2/S3/Lambda/RDS/DynamoDB, SageMaker, scikit-learn, PyTorch, FastAPI, PostgreSQL/pgvector, Docker, CI/CD, SIEM, Active Directory, Linux, Java, .NET, etc.) are supported by the structured profile and artifacts. Only minor formatting differences (e.g., “GPT-4” vs “GPT-4.1 mini”) are present and unambiguous.

Tone: Professionalism: strong formatting, clear headings, correct grammar and polished bullet structure (score 5). Action-Oriented: highly action-focused with measurable impact (e.g., “Automated…1M+ records,” “5× faster,” “~5% accuracy,” “96% cohort graduation rate”), using strong verbs throughout (score 5). Persona Alignment: generally well-matched to cloud/SaaS and integration roles (AWS, Java, Spring Boot, Solutions Architect internship, projects), but minor inconsistencies reduce fit—claim of “over 5 years” contrasts with internship-heavy timeline and expected MS graduation in 2026, and the résumé’s very broad tech stack could dilute role-specific emphasis (score 4). Average converts to a final scaled score of 9/10; no individual score is 2+ points below the others, so no notable mismatch flagged.
Alignment: Strong matches for core technical requirements: Professional Summary and Core Skills explicitly list AWS, Java, Spring Boot, MongoDB, Git, CI/CD, unit testing, microservices and Agile; Experience shows relevant AWS automation and mentoring (Solutions-focused summary; AWS internship; IT Instructor Assistant). Partial matches: claims of 5+ years and senior/engineering leadership are asserted in the summary but resume timeline is dominated by internships and recent graduation (Experience section), so senior-level leadership is not clearly demonstrated. Missing or weak items: no explicit ReactJS/frontend experience, no clear examples of leading code/design reviews or delivering highly concurrent/HA web apps, and functional UX design is absent. Resume does reference Pearson in the summary (good tailoring) but uses some generic language about quality/process. Given multiple strong explicit tech matches but several important partial/absent senior and frontend items, the alignment score is seven.
Impact: The resume includes multiple action-oriented bullets with clear numeric metrics and business impact (e.g., automated pipeline processing 1M+ records with 5× faster feedback loops; SageMaker fine-tuning improving accuracy ~5% and reducing toxicity ~8%; delivered 36 lessons to 200+ learners and maintained a 96% graduation rate). However, several bullets lack measurable results or explicit business outcomes (e.g., “Designed and presented secure, scalable AWS reference architectures,” WOPLLI bullets like Virtual Credential System, Azure configuration, and API scripts), and some phrasing is vague/replaceable (“configured and tested,” “developed API integration”), so I deducted points for missing quantifiable outcomes and mild passive/vague language.
CredTail: Degrees (MSc Data Science & Machine Learning, expected Jan 2026; B.Tech CIS, Jun 2024) are present and match the Retrieval Context. All listed employers, job titles, locations and employment dates (AWS: Jun 2025–Sep 2025; WOPLLI: Jun 2024–Sep 2024; Mayor’s Office: Feb 2024–May 2024; RF CUNY/Generation: Feb 2022–Aug 2023) are verified against the retrieval. Projects (Alfred) and certifications also align. Deductions applied because several core technologies in the Actual Output (e.g., JavaScript, HTML, XML, C#, PHP) are not present in the Retrieval Context (artifact mentions Java/.NET but not those languages), and the Core Skills cloud list omits Bedrock/SageMaker (though they appear in experience highlights). Minor contact-phone variance appears in artifacts but the structured profile matches the resume. Given full consistency on high-weight items (degrees, employers, dates) but some unsupported core-tech claims, the credibility is high with moderate penalty.",265,2025-12-18 20:35:10.460094,8,8

Tone: Professionalism is strong due to clear headings, contact info, consistent sections, and generally good grammar and formatting (education, skills, projects, experience are well organized). Action-oriented strength is evident: frequent strong verbs (Developed, Implemented, Created, Deployed) and measurable results (65,000+ records, 400 devices, 200+ learners, 36 lessons) that clarify responsibility and impact. Persona alignment is moderate: the resume lists core data-science skills and an ongoing Data Science & ML master’s, but projects are skewed toward web/database and IT support rather than ML modeling or results-driven data science work, so the match to an ML-focused role is limited. With those component assessments, the output ranks well on professionalism and action orientation but shows room to improve persona fit by adding ML-specific projects, metrics on modeling outcomes, or relevant coursework/capstone details.
Alignment: Checklist highlights: required tools — SQL, Python/R are explicitly listed in Technical Skills and match; Excel and mainstream BI tools are omitted (no Tableau/PowerBI/Excel mention). Responsibilities — business analysis leadership, cross-departmental influence, and producing persuasive insight decks are missing; resume shows only internship/teaching roles (IT Support Intern, Instructor Assistant) and student projects, so senior-level ownership and 5+ years’ experience requirement are not met. Database work is partially matched by project ERD/SQL scripts and a POS/stock-report project (65k records), but these are academic/projects rather than production business databases. Outcomes/impact — almost no quantified business results or closed-loop project deliveries tied to business metrics; only generic statements about monitoring and student progress tracking. Overall: clear strengths in core technical skills and database/project exposure, but major gaps in experience level, BI/Excel tooling, leadership/impact, and measurable business outcomes required by the role.
Impact: Strong presence of multiple clear metrics (e.g., 65,000+ records, support for over 400 devices, 36 lessons to 200+ learners, GPA 3.78, specific dates), satisfying the requirement for measurable outcomes (Step 1). However, many statements describe activities rather than direct business impact (no quantified revenue, cost, conversion, retention, or efficiency improvements), reducing clarity of business outcome (Step 2). Language is mostly active but includes some vague/passive phrasing like “assisted” and outcome-lite bullets, so minor penalty (Step 3). Overall multiple explicit metrics but limited linkage to business impact, so a high-but-not-top score is appropriate.
CredTail: Following the retrieval context vs the Actual Output: Verified items (23): name, email, phone, LinkedIn, New York City location; Bachelor of Technology at NYC College of Technology (graduation Jun 2024), GPA 3.78, Dean’s List (5x), Honor Society; presence of the Master’s degree (CUNY SPS MS in Data Science & ML); languages Python, R, SQL; broad data-science skills; SDLC/Agile/Git; Azure cloud; Linux; technical writing/documentation; IT Support Intern (Mayor’s Office of Information Services) with dates Feb 2024–May 2024; IT Instructor Assistant (RF CUNY & Generation USA) Feb 2022–Aug 2023. Unverified / mismatched / fabricated items (6): Master’s expected graduation (Actual: Dec 2025 vs Retrieval: Expected Jan 2026) — mismatched; Database-skills wording (Data Normalization/Design Diagrams) — not explicitly present; Windows OS and fluency in English/Spanish — not shown in retrieval; Financial Stocks Report and EZRental projects (dates and tech stack) — not present in retrieval (treated as fabricated). Scoring: 23 of 29 atomic claims verified → base score ≈ 7.9/10. Applied penalties: heavy penalty for two fabricated projects (−2), smaller penalties for the mismatched master’s date and missing OS/language/DB phrasing (−1.0 total), and a minor consistency reduction for the graduation-date discrepancy (−0.5). Final rounded score: 5. The score reflects strong alignment on education (bachelor), contact, core data/infra skills, and the two listed internships, but recent projects and several specific skill phrasings/dates are unsupported or mismatched in the retrieval context.",349,2025-12-18 23:51:18.777917,8,5

Tone: All three evaluation categories score at the top end. Professionalism: polished formatting (clear headings, consistent bullets), correct grammar, and compact contact/education sections. Action-Oriented: strong use of active verbs and measurable outcomes (processed over 1M records; 5× faster feedback-to-action; 5% accuracy gain; 8% reduction in toxicity; 96% cohort graduation). Persona Alignment: tightly aligned to cloud/ML/Solutions Architect roles with relevant technologies (AWS Bedrock, SageMaker, Lambda, QuickSight, RAG, FastAPI) and appropriate tone. No notable weaknesses—scores are balanced and demonstrate consistent strength across professionalism, achievement focus, and persona fit.
Alignment: The resume shows clear strengths on Python/PyTorch, ML model experimentation and deployment (SageMaker), CI/CD and Docker, and quantified outcomes (e.g., 1M records processed, 5× faster turnaround, 5% accuracy gain) — these map to the job’s Python and ML deployment requirements. However it omits several must-haves: no C++ experience or mention of porting models into C++/SDKs, no mobile/platform-specific tooling (iOS/Android/Windows/Linux), no model conversion/runtime tooling (ONNX/CoreML/TensorRT) or explicit inference performance optimization, and little evidence of cross-platform SDK integration. Because only a minority of the required items are explicitly matched (Python/ML/cloud/deployment) and the resume is not tailored to model-porting/C++ SDK work, I score it low-to-moderate with a small bump for quantified impacts and solid deployment experience.
Impact: Strong use of action verbs and several clear, measurable bullets (e.g., AWS internship: “built and deployed…processing over 1M feedback records” with “5× faster feedback-to-action”; fine-tuned models with “5% increase in output accuracy” and “8% reduction in toxicity”; Instructor role: “36 lessons,” “200+ learners,” “96% cohort graduation rate”). These align well with Steps 1–2. Deductions applied because several bullets lack metrics or business outcomes (WOPLLI, Mayor’s Office, Alfred project have no numeric impact), and a few metrics are somewhat ambiguous without baselines or measurement details (the accuracy/toxicity improvements). Overall balance of specific measurable achievements and some vague items warrants a high but not perfect score.
CredTail: Step 1 (context check): degrees, employer names, employment dates, and many core technologies are explicitly present in the Retrieval Context. Comparison (Step 2): the Actual Output accurately reproduces name, contact, MSc and BTech degrees (with GPAs and dates), all listed employers and employment dates, the Alfred project (FastAPI, PostgreSQL+pgvector, RAG, GPT-4.1 mini), and most AWS services (EC2, S3, Lambda, RDS, DynamoDB, Glue, QuickSight, Bedrock, SageMaker). Fabricated item: the Bachelor’s Dean’s List count is changed to “8x” in the Actual Output but the Context shows “5x” (inconsistent/unsupported). Missing items from the Context: the Google Information Support Certificate (present in Context, omitted in Actual Output); smaller omissions in technical stack/details such as AWS Macie, seaborn in Python list, explicit Azure components (App Service/Functions/Storage) and the Google Generative AI integration noted in the project. Overall credibility is reduced due to one clear unsupported alteration and several omitted certifications/technologies, while core items (degrees, employers, dates, major project and most AWS/ML skills) match closely.",268,2025-12-18 23:51:53.317309,8,6

Tone: Professionalism 5/5 — clean, well-organized format with clear headings, consistent bulleting, and no major grammar issues (contact, summary, competencies, and education are polished). Action-Oriented 5/5 — frequent strong verbs (Designed, Built, Automated, Fine-tuned) and multiple quantified outcomes (processed 1M+ records; 5× faster feedback loops; accuracy +5%; toxicity −8%; Alfred: time-to-apply −60%, applications +300%). Persona Alignment 5/5 — content strongly matches a solutions-architect/ML persona (extensive AWS list including Bedrock, SageMaker, Glue; ETL, CI/CD, LLM work, PostgreSQL/pgvector, FastAPI). Average = (5+5+5)/3 = 5.0 (scaled score = 10). Highest criterion: all tied; Lowest criterion: all tied. Minor improvement: standardize a few terms (e.g., “Postgre” → PostgreSQL) and consistent abbreviation use.
Alignment: Following the evaluation steps, key requirements extracted include Go and Angular web development, MongoDB and SQL Server, AWS, microservices, API design, 10+ years' experience, production/P1 incident troubleshooting, unit/automation test suites, mentoring, and (desirable) WCAG/accessibility and JIRA. The resume explicitly matches several technical items (AWS, MongoDB, REST APIs/FastAPI, microservices architecture, Git/CI-CD, SDLC and some quantified project outcomes), but it omits critical, role-specific needs: no Go or Angular experience, no SQL Server or JIRA mention, no clear 10+ years of engineering experience, no stated P1 production incident resolution, and no accessibility/WCAG work or explicit team mentoring. Given multiple strong matches in cloud, APIs, and measurable project results but several major gaps on core tech and seniority, the alignment is partial and warrants a low–mid score.
Impact: The output contains many strong bullets with clear action verbs plus explicit metrics and business outcomes (e.g., “Automated a sentiment-analysis pipeline processing 1M+ records” with “5× faster feedback loops,” fine-tuning results of ~5% accuracy improvement and ~8% toxicity reduction, “Reduced time to apply by 60%” and “boosted weekly applications by 300%,” 96% cohort graduation rate, 800+ devices, 100+ tickets, 36 lessons for 200+ learners). These provide concrete, measurable impact and align with the scoring rules for high specificity. Shortcomings: several bullets remain vague or metric-free (e.g., “Designed and presented secure, scalable AWS reference architectures,” “Built POCs…,” vendor management and many support/Dev bullets), which lowers consistency across the document and triggers modest penalties per the passive/vague language rule. Balancing the strong, numerous quantified outcomes against the remaining non-measured items yields a high but not perfect score.

Missing items: none of the critical items (degrees, employers, dates, or core technologies) are missing. Fabricated/Contradicted items: none detected (no contradictions; alternate phone appears in artifacts but the structured profile matches the resume phone). Scoring rationale: per the evaluation steps nearly all claims are Verified, with zero Missing or Contradicted items, so maximum credibility applies.

Tone: Professionalism: 4/5 — clear, formal resume layout and appropriate headings, but minor issues (typo “Honor's Society” and a timeline inconsistency between “Expected Graduation: May 2024” and an AWS internship dated Jun–Sep 2025) reduce polish. Action-Oriented: 5/5 — strong verbs and measurable outcomes throughout (e.g., “Automated sentiment-analysis pipeline processing 1M+ records, 5× faster,” “reduced integration time by 30%,” “96% cohort graduation rate”). Persona Alignment: 4/5 — content, technical skills, and certifications align well with a solutions-focused technologist/solutions architect persona, though small chronology/detail confusions slightly weaken fit. Average of dimensions yields a high overall score emphasizing action orientation as the strongest and professionalism polish as the weakest area.
Alignment: The resume shows relevant technical skills (Java, Python, JavaScript), cloud experience (AWS + SageMaker), CI/CD and API work (Alfred CI/CD, API integration scripts) and quantified impact (5× faster pipeline, 30–40% efficiency gains, 98% ticket satisfaction). However it fails core meta requirements: no 6+ years (candidate is a soon-to-be graduate / intern), no clear track record of setting technical direction or leading cross-functional product efforts, limited evidence of building custom UIs or owning large-scale product components, and the document reads like a general early-career resume rather than tailored senior Product Software Engineer experience. These strengths and shortcomings yield a below-mid alignment score.
Impact: Strong use of action verbs (Automated, Fine-tuned, Developed, Designed, Achieved) and many clear, measurable metrics across bullets (e.g., 1M+ records, 5× faster feedback loops, 5% accuracy gain, 8% toxicity reduction, 30% integration-time reduction, 40% identity-verification efficiency, 50% manual-workload reduction, 98% satisfaction, 96% graduation rate, 60% time-to-apply reduction, 300% increase in weekly applications, 40% deployment efficiency). Most metrics are tied to concrete business outcomes (faster feedback loops, improved accuracy, reduced integration time, higher user growth/engagement, productivity gains). Minor deductions for a vague summary line and a few bullets that don’t explicitly state revenue or cost savings (focus is largely on efficiency/productivity rather than financial impact).
CredTail: Most core items are supported verbatim or equivalently: name, email, LinkedIn/GitHub, employers and titles (AWS Solutions Architect Intern Jun 2025–Sep 2025; Software Developer Intern WOPLLI Jun 2024–Sep 2024; IT Support Intern Feb 2024–May 2024; IT Instructor Assistant Feb 2022–Aug 2023), core cloud/database technologies (AWS EC2/S3/Lambda, Azure, PostgreSQL/MySQL/Oracle), project “Alfred” reductions (60% time-to-apply) and listed certifications all appear in the retrieval context. Deductions were applied for several discrepancies: phone number differs (Actual: 929-305-7353 vs Retrieval: 347-491-2955), graduation month differs (Actual: May 2024 vs Retrieval: Jun 2024), and a few fabricated numeric claims in the Actual Output that are not in the retrieval evidence (a 98% satisfaction rate for tickets and a 40% deployment-efficiency improvement). Also one security phrase (“Cyber Kill Chain”) is not present in the retrieval. Because the vast majority of critical degrees, employers, dates, and technologies are supported but a few specific metrics and one contact field are inconsistent or invented, the credibility score reflects mostly supported content with minor but tangible fabrications.",331,2025-12-18 23:53:04.050784,9,8

Tone: The resume demonstrates high professionalism—clean formatting, clear headings, contact links, and error-free grammar. It is strongly action-oriented, using concise verbs and multiple quantified impacts (e.g., processing over 1M feedback records, 5× faster feedback-to-action, 5% accuracy increase, 8% toxicity reduction, 96% graduation rate). Persona alignment is excellent for a software/ML/cloud role with healthcare emphasis (mentions GE HealthCare, SageMaker, cross-platform SDKs, AWS services). All three evaluation dimensions are consistently strong with no category differing by 2+ points, so there is no notable mismatch.
Alignment: The resume shows clear strengths: the Professional Summary explicitly claims experience integrating ML models into cross-platform SDKs and lists required tools (Python, C++, PyTorch, SageMaker, Docker, CI/CD), and projects demonstrate deployment and model fine-tuning. However, it lacks explicit, verifiable examples of the core job tasks: no concrete bullet demonstrating porting Python models into a C++ SDK, no mention of mobile inference toolchains (CoreML/TFLite/ONNX, NDK/CMake) or measured performance improvements on iOS/Android, and minimal clinical/ultrasound domain work beyond a high-level summary. Given several partial matches (skills present but missing hands‑on C++ SDK/mobile inference evidence) and some generic language/tailoring beyond the summary, the alignment is moderate.
Impact: Multiple bullets include strong, measurable results and clear business impact (notably AWS sentiment pipeline: >1M records and 5× faster feedback-to-action; AWS model fine-tuning: +5% accuracy, −8% toxicity; IT Instructor: 36 lessons for 200+ learners and 96% graduation). However many bullets lack one or both required elements (quantifiable metrics and explicit business outcomes)—e.g., WOPLLI items (Virtual Credential System, Azure config, diagrams), several IT Support bullets (automation without %/time saved), and most project bullets. I applied the requested rubric: multiple fully-specified bullets earn credit, then subtracted points for each missing metric/outcome across other bullets and applied a small penalty for vague/passive phrasing (e.g., “configured,” “produced,” “supported”), resulting in a mid-range alignment score.
CredTail: Verified: name, location, email, phone, LinkedIn/GitHub links; both degrees and expected/graduation dates (MS expected Jan 2026; B.Tech Jun 2024) are present in the Retrieval Context; employers and employment dates match for AWS (Solutions Architect Intern Jun 2025–Sep 2025), WOPLLI (Jun 2024–Sep 2024), Mayor’s Office (Feb 2024–May 2024), and RF CUNY/Generation USA (Feb 2022–Aug 2023); core technologies and tools (Python, pandas, scikit-learn, PyTorch, SQL/NoSQL, AWS services including SageMaker, Bedrock/Glue/QuickSight, FastAPI, PostgreSQL/pgvector, Docker, CI/CD, Git, SIEM, Active Directory, Linux) are largely present in the Retrieval Context and align with the Actual Output; certifications largely match (AWS Solutions Architect, AWS AI Practitioner, Google Cybersecurity), though Retrieval lists an additional Google Information Support Certificate not shown in the Actual Output (omission). Conflicts / omissions: the Bachelor’s Dean’s List count differs (Actual claims 8× vs Retrieval shows 5×), master’s Dean’s List appears in Retrieval (2×) but is not reflected the same way in the Actual Output (omission); the resume’s claims about integrating ML into cross-platform SDKs for iOS/Android/Windows and applying AI to clinical/early disease-detection are not supported in the Retrieval Context (unsupported/fabricated claims). Rationale for score: high-weight items (degrees, employers, dates, major core technologies) are consistent, but unsupported/overstated claims and the substantive discrepancy in Dean’s List counts reduce credibility, so the output merits a strong but not perfect score.",270,2025-12-18 23:53:50.957045,5,8
203,1177,P0,10,10,5,43,"Punctuality: The score is 1.00 because the Contradictions list is empty, indicating no discrepancies between the actual output and the retrieval context—great job, the output fully aligns.
Tone: Professionalism: 5 — polished, well-structured resume with clear sections, good grammar, contact links (LinkedIn/GitHub) and consistent formatting. Action-Oriented: 5 — strong action verbs and measurable outcomes (automated sentiment pipeline processing 1M+ records, 5× faster feedback loops, SageMaker fine-tuning +~5% accuracy and −~8% toxicity, 96% cohort graduation). Persona Alignment: 5 — excellent fit for a solutions-architect/data-science role (extensive AWS stack: Bedrock, Glue, SageMaker; RAG, FastAPI, CI/CD, data engineering and ML skills). Average = 5.0. Highest: all criteria tied; Lowest: none (tie).
Alignment: Extracted requirements included cross-functional collaboration, custom UI implementation, code optimization/reviews, leadership/mentorship, scalable system architecture, performance/scalability fixes, multi-language experience, component ownership, 8+ years programming (or PhD), and ML/NLP/IR frameworks (PyTorch, scikit-learn, TensorFlow), plus metrics. The resume explicitly matches many technical/tool requirements (Python, PyTorch, scikit-learn, SageMaker, Bedrock, RAG/pgvector for retrieval, AWS architectures, Docker, CI/CD) and provides quantified outcomes (processed 1M+ records, 5× faster feedback, +5% accuracy, −8% toxicity). It partially matches systems/scale and performance work (AWS reference architectures, pipeline automation) and shows project-level ownership (Alfred). Major shortcomings versus the posting are missing seniority/years (no 8+ years), limited evidence of leading organization-level initiatives or mentoring/setting technical direction, no explicit custom UI/front-end experience, and no explicit code-review/peer-feedback ownership or Meta-specific product-scale experience. Overall, strong technical and ML alignment but significant gaps on seniority and leadership/UX responsibilities, so scored in the mid-range.
Impact: Several bullets meet the highest criteria: e.g., the AWS intern entries include clear actions with numeric metrics and business impact (automated pipeline processing 1M+ records with 5× faster feedback loops; fine-tuning that improved accuracy ~5% and reduced toxicity ~8%), and the instructor role provides concrete output (36 lessons, 200+ learners, 96% graduation). These demonstrate action + numeric metric + impact. However, multiple bullets (e.g., “Designed and presented secure, scalable AWS reference architectures,” “Built POCs…to deliver actionable sentiment insights,” Virtual Credential System, automated troubleshooting) lack measurable results or explicit business outcomes and some language is generic, which warrants a penalty per the evaluation steps. Given the strong measurable items balanced against several vague entries, the overall alignment is high but not perfect.
CredTail: Verified items: degrees (M.S. Data Science & ML expected Jan 2026; B.Tech CIS Jun 2024 with GPAs and honors), employers and dates (AWS Solutions Architect Intern Jun 2025–Sep 2025; WOPLLI Jun 2024–Sep 2024; Mayor’s Office Feb 2024–May 2024; RF CUNY & Generation USA Feb 2022–Aug 2023), core technologies and project details (Python libs, SQL/NoSQL, AWS services including Bedrock/SageMaker/Glue/QuickSight, Azure services, FastAPI, PostgreSQL+pgvector, OpenAI GPT-4.1 mini, Docker, CI/CD) and certifications — all present in the Retrieval Context and match the Actual Output. Missing items: none of the critical items (degrees, employers, dates, core technologies) are missing. Fabricated/Contradicted items: none identified. Justification: nearly every explicit claim in the Actual Output is directly supported by the structured Retrieval Context (matching companies, dates, education entries, tech stack, project highlights and certifications), so no penalties apply under the stated rules.",232,2025-12-18 23:54:25.849101,8,10
204,682,P2,8.857142857142858,9,2,29.857142857142858,"Punctuality: The score is 0.89 because the actual output contains multiple mismatches with the retrieval context: it uses the phone number 929-305-7353 instead of the structured profile phone 347-491-2955 (the artifact header lists 929-305-7353), it gives conflicting graduation timing (artifact says May 2024 while the structured profile lists Jun 2024), it incorrectly marks the IT Support Intern role as ongoing (02/2024–Current) though the context lists Feb 2024–May 2024, and it understates device refurbishments by claiming >400 devices while the context reports over 800.
Tone: Applied the evaluation steps: Professionalism is strong—clear headings, consistent bullets, readable formatting and few grammatical issues (minor date/format inconsistencies prevent perfection). Action-Oriented is very strong—uses clear action verbs and concrete metrics (restored 400 devices; taught 36 lessons to 200 learners; 96% cohort graduation; generated reports from 65,000+ records). Persona Alignment is good—skills, AWS certification, projects and internship responsibilities align with entry-level IT/support/developer roles, though it could be tightened to a specific target role and emphasize impact/results more consistently. I averaged the three category assessments and converted to the 10-point scale for the final score.
Alignment: Resume shows a few relevant skills (Power BI, C#, XML, REST/SOAP, Visual Studio, generic SQL and SQL scripts) and some quantified project outcomes (65,000 records processed, 400 devices restored, 96% graduation rate). However it omits or only generically references most critical job requirements: no SSIS/SSRS/SSAS, no IIS Server or SFTP management, no SSIS package/ETL package development, no SQL Server stored procedures or explicit SQL Server development, no RPA/Workato/Okta API experience, and lacks the required Master’s + 3 years (candidate is a bachelor’s student/intern). Because only a few low-confidence matches exist and major, high-priority items are missing, the alignment is poor.
Impact: The output contains multiple explicit metrics (GPA 3.8; restored over 400 devices; taught 36 lessons to 200+ learners; 96% cohort graduation; 65,000+ records), which meets the criterion for multiple clear metrics (step 1) and supports measurable accomplishments. Business impact is moderately clear—device restoration and high graduation rate imply efficiency and training effectiveness—but it lacks direct financial or conversion metrics (step 2). Language includes several weak/passive phrases (""provide support,"" ""assist,"" ""participate""), which reduces clarity and results orientation and warrants a penalty (step 3). Overall strong on measurable counts and relevance but held back by passive wording and limited explicit business-impact framing, and thus scores in the upper-mid range (step 4).
CredTail: Verified items (from Retrieval Context): education entry and institution, GPA 3.8 and Expected Graduation May 2024 (artifact lines), RF CUNY / Generation USA IT Instructor Assistant role and Feb 2022–Aug 2023 dates, Mayor’s Office of Information Services as an employer, contact details (email, LinkedIn URL, 929-305-7353 phone present in artifacts), core skills clearly present (Python, SQL/MySQL, AWS, Power BI, REST, Git, Java noted in artifacts/summary), and certifications (AWS Solutions Architect – Associate, Google Cybersecurity, Google Information Support). Unverified / mismatched / fabricated items: Mayor’s Office employment dates are mismatched (Actual lists 02/2024–Current vs Retrieval shows Feb 2024–May 2024), device refurbishment counts differ (Actual: “over 400” vs Retrieval: “over 800”), project entries (Financial Stocks Report, EzRental) are not present in the Retrieval Context, and several listed technologies in Actual (JavaScript, HTML, XML, PHP, SOAP, Visual Studio, Microsoft Office, explicit “C#”) are not found verbatim in the Retrieval Context. Scoring logic: base ratio of verified to claimed items (~23 verified of ~33 claimed → ~7/10) was reduced for major fabrications/mismatches (heavy penalty for the Mayor’s Office date conflict and conflicting device counts) and further reduced for missing but plausible items (absent projects and multiple unverified technologies) and internal inconsistency between “Current” employment vs Retrieval end date. These penalties produced the final credibility assessment.",354,2025-12-18 23:54:55.251077,7,3
205,1056,P1,10,10,7,43,"Punctuality: The score is 1.00 because there are no contradictions (Contradictions: []) — the actual output fully aligns with the retrieval context. Great job staying faithful!
Tone: The resume is highly professional with clean formatting, correct grammar, and clear sectioning (contact, summary, education, skills, experience, projects, certifications). It is strongly action-oriented with active verbs and measurable outcomes (e.g., “processing 1M+ records,” “5× faster feedback loops,” “improving accuracy by ~5%,” “reducing toxicity by ~8%,” “96% cohort graduation rate,” “over 100 tickets”). Persona alignment is excellent for a solutions-architect/data-science role—AWS/SageMaker/Bedrock, ETL, and ML details match the target persona and responsibilities. All three categories are balanced strengths with no significant weaknesses identified.
Alignment: I extracted 17 required checklist items (core responsibilities and minimum quals 10–19). The resume explicitly matches 10 items (languages: PHP/Java/C#, React/React Native, JavaScript, SQL/relational DBs; AWS services and large-scale pipelines processing 1M+ records; Bachelor’s degree; data processing/ETL; cloud infra and FastAPI project), shows partial matches on 6 items (product/codebase understanding, test coverage/release standards, exercising judgment, applying algorithms to production, some SDLC/CI-CD mention), and misses conducting design/code reviews. That yields ~59% required-item coverage (maps to a base score in the 5–6 range). I increased the score for clear, quantified impacts (1M+ records, 5× faster feedback loops, accuracy/toxicity metrics) and specific tool usage, and only slightly penalized remaining generic phrasing around release/test practices — final score reflects these adjustments.
Impact: The resume frequently uses explicit action verbs and includes clear, measurable metrics in key bullets (e.g., automated sentiment pipeline processing 1M+ records with 5× faster feedback loops; fine-tuned SageMaker models improving accuracy ~5% and reducing toxicity ~8%; delivered 36 lessons to 200+ learners with a 96% graduation rate). These demonstrate accomplishment + metric + business outcome in several high-impact bullets. However, several bullets (WOPLLI role, some IT Support items, and project descriptions) are vague or lack measurable outcomes and business impact, so points are deducted for incomplete metrics and uneven specificity across entries.
CredTail: Retrieval Context explicitly contains degrees (MS expected Jan 2026; B.Tech Jun 2024), employer names (Amazon Web Services, WOPLLI Technologies, Mayor’s Office of Information Services, RF CUNY & Generation USA) with employment dates (e.g., Jun 2025–Sep 2025, Jun 2024–Sep 2024, Feb 2024–May 2024, Feb 2022–Aug 2023), and many core technologies (Python, SQL/NoSQL, AWS services including Bedrock/Macie/SageMaker, Azure App Service/Functions/Storage, FastAPI, Docker, Postgre/pgvector, OpenAI GPT-4.1 mini, QuickSight, Glue, etc.). The Actual Output matches most critical items: contact info, both degrees and honors, all employers and their dates, project details (Alfred/RAG/FastAPI/OpenAI GPT-4.1 mini), and key AWS experience (Bedrock/Glue/Lambda/Athena, SageMaker fine-tuning, 1M+ record pipeline). Discrepancies: the Actual Output lists technologies not present in the structured context (PHP, C#, React Native) — flagged as unsupported/fabricated relative to the provided context. It also omits several context technologies/highlights (e.g., Macie, explicit mention of CrowdStrike/log monitoring and device refurbishment/ServiceNow from the IT Support role, R Programming and Power BI called out in core_skills). Given strong alignment on critical items (degrees, employers, dates, major projects) but a few fabricated tech entries and omitted secondary technologies/details, I deducted a few points.",273,2025-12-18 23:55:00.162937,8,8

Tone: Professionalism is strong: the resume is well-structured and formal with clear sections (Summary, Core Skills, Experience, Projects, Education, Certifications) and complete contact links. Action-oriented content is excellent: it uses strong verbs (Automated, Fine-tuned, Developed, Configured) and many measurable outcomes (1M+ records, 5× faster feedback loops, +5% accuracy / −8% toxicity, +30% deployment speed, −40% manual workload, 96% cohort graduation rate, −60% application time / +300% applications). Persona alignment is also excellent: content and certifications (AWS Solutions Architect, SageMaker work, data science MS, cloud and ML projects like Alfred) match a cloud/AI/data-focused candidate. All three dimensions are consistently strong with no clear weakest area; only minor polish (tiny formatting consistency or phrasing tweaks) could further improve presentation.
Alignment: The resume shows partial alignment: it lists key languages (Python, Java, JavaScript), SQL, Git, CI/CD/Docker, AWS cloud and databases—matching several required tools/technologies. It also includes concrete, quantifiable outcomes (e.g., 5× pipeline speedup, 30% faster deployments). Major shortcomings: no explicit Linux/UNIX or shell scripting, no mention of C++ or editor tools (VIM/Emacs), no evidence of OS-level software, compilers, network distribution work, or distributed-systems engineering at the scale described. The experience is internship-heavy and likely under the two-year work expectation, and the resume does not demonstrate mastering development/release standards, test coverage, or projects that mirror Meta’s large-scale systems responsibilities. These gaps and somewhat generic focus on data/cloud (not systems-level) justify a low–moderate alignment score.
Impact: Strong use of action verbs and multiple clear metrics across bullets (e.g., “Automated…1M+ records, 5× faster feedback loops”; SageMaker: +5% accuracy, −8% toxicity; Azure: +30% deployment speed; −40% manual workload; 96% graduation rate; project: −60% application time, +300% weekly applications). Most actions are tied to concrete business outcomes (efficiency, faster feedback, higher throughput/user growth). Shortcomings: a few vague/unsupported phrases remain (summary: “enhancing application throughput”; “enhancing code quality”; “excellent service reviews” without quantification), so slight penalty for remaining non‑specific claims.
CredTail: Most core items are supported verbatim or equivalently in the retrieval context: name, contact info, LinkedIn/GitHub, summary, AWS Solutions Architect Intern (Jun 2025–Sep 2025) with 1M+ records and 5× faster feedback loops and SageMaker fine-tuning (~5% accuracy, ~8% toxicity), Software Developer Intern at WOPLLI (Jun 2024–Sep 2024), IT Support Intern (Feb 2024–May 2024), IT Instructor Assistant (Feb 2022–Aug 2023), Alfred project details, education degrees and honors, and listed certifications and core technologies (Python, SQL, JavaScript/Java, PostgreSQL/MySQL/Oracle/DynamoDB, AWS/Azure, CI/CD/Docker/Git) all appear in the retrieval context. Deductions applied for fabricated numeric performance claims not present in the retrieval context: the WOPLLI item claiming a 30% improved deployment speed and the IT Support item claiming a 40% reduction in manual workload (these specific percentages do not appear in the retrieval data). Minor formatting differences (CUNY campus naming) are non-material. Final score reflects strong alignment with two minor fabrications.",336,2025-12-18 23:55:50.399083,8,8

Tone: High professionalism: well-structured, consistent headings, clean contact block and no grammar issues. Strong action orientation: uses active verbs and numerous quantified impacts (e.g., “automated a sentiment-analysis pipeline processing 1M+ records,” “5× faster feedback loops,” “improved accuracy by ~5% / reduced toxicity by ~8%,” “60% time reduction” and “300% increase in weekly applications”). Strong persona alignment: content and tooling (AWS Bedrock, SageMaker, Athena/Glue/Lambda, FastAPI, LLMs, Azure) clearly target software/ML roles at large tech firms (explicit Meta mention in summary). No score shows a 2+ point discrepancy versus the others, so no notable mismatch.
Alignment: Strong matches to many required items: Bachelor’s degree confirmed (B.Tech, Jun 2024); explicit listing of required languages (Python, Java, C++, PHP, C#) and JavaScript; React listed; relational DB/SQL (PostgreSQL, MySQL) present; AWS/Azure experience and a scalable pipeline processing 1M+ records demonstrate large-scale infra. Partial matches: claims of test coverage and SDLC/CI-CD are in the summary and core skills but lack concrete examples of unit/integration tests or release process. Absent or weak evidence for several Minimum Qualification specifics: no explicit examples of conducting design/code reviews, limited demonstration of applying algorithms/core CS concepts in production, and no clear HTML/CSS/web UI implementation examples. Minor penalty for some generic wording in the summary. Overall fit is strong with several partials/omissions, so the score reflects a few justified deductions.
Impact: The resume contains multiple strong, measurable bullets (e.g., AWS intern: automated pipeline processing 1M+ records with 5× faster feedback loops; SageMaker fine-tuning improved accuracy ~5% and reduced toxicity ~8%; Alfred project: 60% reduction in time-to-apply and 300% boost in weekly applications; IT Instructor: 36 lessons for 200+ learners and 96% graduation rate). However, many bullets (notably all four Software Developer bullets, several AWS/IT Support items, and some Ops tasks) lack numeric metrics and explicit business outcomes. Roughly 6 of ~15 bullets include clear numeric metrics + outcomes; the rest are action-oriented but unquantified. Language is mostly active, so only a small penalty for some vague/low-impact phrasing. Given multiple high-quality metrics but many missing quantification, the overall alignment scores in the mid-high band.
CredTail: High fidelity: degrees (MSc expected Jan 2026; BTech Jun 2024), institutions, GPAs, and honors are present in the Retrieval Context and match the Actual Output. All listed employers and employment dates (Solutions Architect Intern at AWS Jun 2025–Sep 2025; Software Developer Intern at WOPLLI Jun 2024–Sep 2024; IT Support Intern Mayor’s Office Feb 2024–May 2024; IT Instructor Assistant RF CUNY & Generation USA Feb 2022–Aug 2023) are present and consistent. Major core technologies and tools claimed in the Actual Output are verifiable in the Retrieval Context (Python, SQL/NoSQL, AWS services including EC2/S3/Lambda/Glue/QuickSight/Bedrock/SageMaker, Azure, FastAPI, Docker, PostgreSQL/MySQL/MongoDB/Oracle/DynamoDB, QuickSight, SageMaker, OpenAI/GPT, Postman, CI/CD). Minor discrepancies: the Actual Output lists C++, PHP, and C# in Programming Languages but these specific languages do not appear in the Retrieval Context (treated as small fabrications). One naming variance (Actual: “GPT-4 Mini” vs Retrieval: “OpenAI GPT-4.1 mini”) is effectively equivalent and not penalized. Because high-weight items (degrees, employers, dates, major cloud/AI technologies) fully match and only minor, non-critical language additions are unsupported, I applied a small deduction for those fabrications.",275,2025-12-18 23:56:56.216058,7,9

Tone: Professionalism 5/5 — polished, well-structured formatting, clear headings, correct grammar and concise bullets. Action-Oriented 5/5 — strong use of active verbs and measurable outcomes (e.g., “1M+ records,” “5× faster feedback loops,” “~5% accuracy gain,” “~8% toxicity reduction,” “96% cohort graduation,” “100+ tickets”). Persona Alignment 5/5 — vocabulary, cloud/ML technologies (AWS, Bedrock, SageMaker, Glue, QuickSight) and emphasis on architectures and pipelines fit a Solutions Architect/Data Science persona. Average = 5/5; relative strengths are uniformly high across all categories, with only a minor nitpick around a potential date-sequencing/expected-graduation clarity issue.
Alignment: I extracted 13 must-have items from the job (8 leadership/responsibility items + 5 minimum qualifications) and marked preferred language/experience as nice-to-have. The resume explicitly matches communication of complex systems, AWS architecture/design, data pipelines/analytics (POC using Bedrock/Athena/Glue, 1M+ records, QuickSight dashboards), and lists relevant languages (Python, Java, JavaScript) and tooling — plus several quantified outcomes (5× faster feedback loop, ~5% model accuracy gain, 8% toxicity reduction, 96% cohort graduation). It only partially matches leadership-scale items (mentions leading technical projects and vendor collaboration but only internship/teaching roles, no multi-year roadmap or cross-company efforts), and misses critical requirements: planning multi-year roadmaps, driving large cross-functional/industry-wide engineering efforts, influencing executive stakeholders, and explicit work reducing technical debt or long-term roadmaps. I also penalized generic leadership phrasing and the early-career / internship nature of evidence despite solid technical details. Based on roughly 2 full + ~6 partial matches out of 13 required items (≈38% coverage) and mixed quality of outcomes/tailoring, the score reflects limited alignment for a senior/principal infrastructure leadership role.
Impact: The resume uses strong action verbs and several clear measurable achievements (e.g., “Automated a sentiment-analysis pipeline processing 1M+ records” with “5× faster feedback loops,” model fine-tuning improving accuracy ~5% and reducing toxicity ~8%, 36 lessons for 200+ learners and a 96% graduation rate). However, several bullets lack measurable outcomes or business impact (e.g., “Designed and presented secure, scalable AWS reference architectures,” “Designed a Virtual Credential System”) and contain somewhat generic phrasing in places, which reduces overall specificity. Scored to reflect multiple high-quality, metric-driven bullets balanced against several vague/no-metric items and occasional generic language.
CredTail: Step 1 — Retrieval Context checks: degrees present (MS Data Science expected Jan 2026; BS Computer Information Systems Jun 2024), employer names present (Amazon Web Services, WOPLLI Technologies, Mayor’s Office of Information Services, RF CUNY & Generation USA), employment dates present (Jun 2025–Sep 2025, Jun 2024–Sep 2024, Feb 2024–May 2024, Feb 2022–Aug 2023), and many core technologies listed (Python + libs, AWS services including Bedrock/SageMaker/Macie, Azure services, Glue/SSIS, QuickSight/Power BI, R, PostgreSQL/pgvector, FastAPI, Docker, CI/CD, etc.). Step 2 — Comparison: the Actual Output aligns closely with the Context for contact info, summary, education, experience titles, companies, dates, and certifications (matched). There are no apparent fabricated claims. Missing/omitted items: the Projects section (Alfred) from the Context is absent in the Actual Output; several core technologies present in Context are omitted or reduced in the Actual Output’s core skills (seaborn, Bedrock and Macie and SageMaker not listed in Core Skills though referenced in experience, Azure Storage, Power BI, R Programming, guardrails, SIEM/IDS, some specific IT support highlights like log monitoring and device refurbishment/ServiceNow). Step 3 — Scoring rationale: no fabrications (no large deductions), critical items (degrees/employers/dates) are present (no deduction), but multiple technology and project omissions warrant modest deductions. Given accurate major items but several notable omissions, the credibility score is eight.",278,2025-12-18 23:58:24.582592,7,8
209,3,P4,9.032258064516128,7,3,32.03225806451613,"Punctuality: The score is 0.90 because the actual output misstates three items in the profile: it lists the MS expected date as Dec 2025 (retrieval context expects Jan 2026), it lists the Bachelor completion as Dec 2024 instead of Jun 2024 (though the 3.78 GPA does match the profile), and it undercounts device work by saying ~400+ devices were restored when the profile documents refurbishing and tracking over 800 devices for redeployment.
Tone: Professionalism 4/5 — clear, formal structure with complete contact, education, experience, projects and skills sections; minor formatting/inconsistency opportunities (some bullets lack parallel detail). Action-Oriented 4/5 — uses strong verbs (designed, developed, automated) and includes measurable outcomes (30% reduction in resolution time, 400+ devices restored, 96% graduation rate, 20% forecast improvement, web app with 65,000+ records), though several items (e.g., “Configured Azure environments”) lack quantified impact. Persona Alignment 3/5 — demonstrates relevant technical breadth but reads as generic rather than tailored to a specific role/company; missing targeted keywords and explicit alignment to a hiring persona. The average of these component ratings is mid-high; strongest dimensions are Professionalism and Action-Orientation, weakest is Persona Alignment, indicating the resume is well-written and results-focused but should be better tailored to the intended employer/role.
Alignment: The resume shows some relevant skills (strong Python, SQL/MSSQL, Hadoop, data modeling via a normalized MSSQL database, and finance-related projects like a 65k-record stock report and a 20% improved ARIMA forecast) and includes quantifiable outcomes (30% resolution time reduction, 400+ devices restored). However it omits several core, mandatory requirements from the job: no explicit experience with global financial instruments (equities, fixed income, options, exotic assets), no named ETL tools/processes (e.g., Airflow/Spark) or clear ETL workflow experience, and no data warehousing design/optimization experience. The experience is largely internship/project-level and untailored to the Data Engineer role at DL Software, so alignment is limited.
Impact: Strong use of action verbs and multiple clear, measurable metrics (e.g., “reduced resolution time by 30%,” “restored 400+ devices,” “36 lessons to 200+ learners with a 96% graduation rate,” “65,000+ records,” and “forecast accuracy by 20%”), which tie several bullets to concrete productivity and accuracy outcomes. Most bullets are active and outcome-focused, but several items remain vague or lack quantified business impact (e.g., “enhancing secure application hosting,” “improving project clarity and execution,” “enhancing system security posture”), which prevents a top score. Overall good metric density and attribution with some room to replace general descriptors with quantified business outcomes.
CredTail: Many core employment items are supported: the three internships (WOPLLI Technologies Jun 2024–Sep 2024; Mayor’s Office Feb 2024–May 2024; IT Instructor Feb 2022–Aug 2023) and several core skills (Python, R, SQL/NoSQL, MySQL, MS SQL Server, Git, Docker, Power BI) appear in the Retrieval Context. However there are multiple important discrepancies: the Master’s expected date in the Actual (Dec 2025) conflicts with Retrieval (Expected Jan 2026); the Bachelor’s date (Actual Dec 2024) conflicts with Retrieval (Jun 2024); core technologies Tableau and Hadoop listed in the Actual are not present in the Retrieval; JavaScript is not clearly supported in the Retrieval; numerical highlights are fabricated or changed (Actual “restored 400+ devices” vs Retrieval “refurbished and tracked over 800 devices”; the “30% reduction” claim is unsupported). Several projects in the Actual (Financial Stocks Report, EZ‑Rental MSSQL project, Forecasting ATM Cash Demand, Anomaly Detection) are not present in the Retrieval. Given most employers/dates and many skills are supported but there are multiple significant date mismatches and fabricated/missing technical and metric details, the credibility is moderate — score reflects these specific omissions and fabrications.",341,2025-12-18 23:59:26.444211,8,5

Tone: Professionalism: polished, well-structured resume with clear headers, contact links, and consistent formatting (strong grammar and presentation). Action-Oriented: excellent use of action verbs and measurable outcomes (e.g., “1M+ records,” “5× faster feedback loops,” “improved accuracy by ~5%,” “reduced time by 60%,” “300% boost”), showing impact. Persona Alignment: well matched to solutions-architect/data-science roles (AWS, SageMaker, LLMs, cloud/data engineering skills); minor shortcomings include a few generic summary phrases and slightly nonstandard certification naming, but overall fit is strong. Average of category ratings (~4.7/5) maps to a near-top score; no category is 2+ points below the others, so no major mismatch flagged.
Alignment: The resume explicitly matches several technical requirements (lists C/C++/Java, Python/JavaScript/Hack in Core Skills; AWS/Azure cloud experience and an AWS Solutions Architect internship; a scalable pipeline processing 1M+ records and 5× faster feedback loops), and the Professional Summary claims multi‑year roadmaps, cross‑functional leadership, and data‑driven communication. However, major leadership/infrastructure expectations are only partially or not evidenced: no principal/senior title or long tenure (Preferred 8+ years is absent), no concrete examples of leading large cross‑company efforts or multi‑year roadmap planning at scale (claims in summary are unsupported by long-term role descriptions), limited evidence of mentoring executive stakeholders beyond a statement, and missing explicit practices for quality (code review/testing/monitoring) and reducing technical debt. Also, the resume is generic rather than Meta‑tailored. These gaps lead to a below‑mid alignment score.
Impact: The output includes multiple strong, measurable bullets (e.g., AWS pipeline processing 1M+ records with 5× faster feedback loops; SageMaker fine-tuning +5% accuracy/-8% toxicity; IT Instructor: 36 lessons, 200+ learners, 96% graduation; Alfred: −60% time to apply, +300% weekly applications) — four fully-specified bullets out of ~12. However, many bullets lack one or more required elements: several AWS/WOPLLI/IT Support bullets have clear actions but no quantifiable metrics or explicit business outcomes (e.g., “Designed and presented secure, scalable AWS reference architectures,” “Configured and tested Azure cloud environments,” “Automated troubleshooting workflows…reduce manual workload”); this reduces impact. Language is mostly active but some phrases are vague/high-level (e.g., “deliver actionable sentiment insights,” “adept at utilizing data analysis”), meriting a small penalty. Given multiple high-quality metrics but many incomplete bullets, the response fits the mid-high band.
CredTail: High-weight items fully match: both degrees (MSc Data Science & ML expected Jan 2026; BTech CIS Jun 2024 with GPAs and honors) are present and consistent in the Retrieval Context. All employers and employment dates are verified (AWS Solutions Architect Intern Jun 2025–Sep 2025; WOPLLI Software Developer Intern Jun 2024–Sep 2024; Mayor’s Office IT Support Feb 2024–May 2024; IT Instructor Assistant Feb 2022–Aug 2023). Core technologies largely verify: AWS (EC2, S3, Lambda, RDS, DynamoDB plus Bedrock, Glue, SageMaker, QuickSight), Azure (App Service, Functions), ETL/ELT (Glue, SSIS), Generative AI (LLMs, prompt structuring, fine-tuning), Data Viz (QuickSight, Power BI), FastAPI/Postman, Docker, Git, CI/CD, and security items (SIEM, IDS, Active Directory, Linux) all appear in the Retrieval Context. Deduction reason: several programming languages listed in the Actual Output (notably C, C++, and Hack) are not present in the structured core_skills (while Java/JavaScript appear in other artifacts, C/C++/Hack are absent), representing unverified claims/omissions. Because high-weight items are consistent and only a few lower-weight tech claims are unverified, a small penalty was applied to reflect those omissions.",280,2025-12-19 00:00:02.750919,7,9

Tone: Professionalism 4/5: well-formatted, clear grammar and polished sections but minor inconsistencies (Markdown-style header, some tech names like “Postgre” and small naming inconsistencies) prevent a perfect score. Action-Oriented 5/5: strong use of action verbs and measurable outcomes (e.g., automated pipeline processing 1M+ records, 5× faster feedback loops, 60% time reduction, 300% increase in weekly applications, 96% graduation rate). Persona Alignment 4/5: strong alignment with solutions-architect/data-science roles (AWS, Bedrock, SageMaker, LLMs, architecture work) though some items read intern-level or could better emphasize business impact at scale. Average = 4.33/5 (mapped to a 0–10 scale = 9). Highest: Action-Oriented. Lowest: Professionalism and Persona Alignment (tied).
Alignment: Extracted requirements include collaboration with cross-functional teams (1), custom UI development (2), reusable backend-facing components (3), code quality/performance optimization (4), technical leadership (5), scalable system architecture (6), performance/scalability troubleshooting (7), multi-language experience (8), and ownership (9); minimums require a BS and 6+ years or equivalent (10–12); preferred items include Python/JS scripting, large-scale infra, ownership, reliability/QA practices, and C/C++/Java exposure (14–21). The resume explicitly matches several infra requirements and tools: backend/API development (FastAPI, REST), Python and AWS services (EC2, S3, Lambda, Glue, SageMaker), microservices, CI/CD, containerization, and quantified outcomes (1M+ record pipeline, 5× faster feedback loops, model improvements ~5%/8%, Alfred project results). That addresses requirements 3,4,6,7,8 (explicit) and partially addresses 1 and 9 (cross-functional/vendor relations, project ownership on Alfred). Major gaps: does not demonstrate the seniority/6+ years or track record of setting technical direction (5/10–12), lacks evidence of custom UI/mobile/web work (2), and has no C/C++/Java exposure listed (preferred 21). Given concrete, quantified infra work but missing key experience and leadership expectations, the resume shows partial alignment overall.
Impact: Strong presence of action verbs with explicit metrics and business impact in multiple bullets (e.g., automated sentiment pipeline processing 1M+ records with 5× faster feedback loops; fine-tuned models improving accuracy ~5% and reducing toxicity ~8%; Alfred project cutting apply time by 60% and increasing weekly applications 300%; 96% cohort graduation rate; refurbished 800+ devices; delivered 36 lessons to 200+ learners). However, several bullets lack measurable outcomes or clear impact (e.g., “Designed and presented secure, scalable AWS reference architectures,” “Configured and tested Azure cloud environments,” “Managed relations with 3rd-party vendors”), which reduces overall consistency. Passive/vague statements are limited but present, warranting a modest penalty.
CredTail: Verified items: personal info (name, location, email, phone, LinkedIn, GitHub); summary; full core competencies (Python, SQL/NoSQL, AWS services including Bedrock and SageMaker, Azure services, ETL/Glue/SSIS, Generative AI, QuickSight/Power BI, FastAPI, Docker, PostgreSQL/pgvector, OpenAI GPT-4.1 mini, etc.); all professional experiences with employers and dates (Solutions Architect Intern at AWS Jun 2025–Sep 2025; Software Developer Intern at WOPLLI Jun 2024–Sep 2024; IT Support Intern at Mayor’s Office Feb 2024–May 2024; IT Instructor Assistant Feb 2022–Aug 2023) and their highlights; project “Alfred” tech stack and outcomes; education entries and dates (MS expected Jan 2026 with GPA 4.0; BS Jun 2024 with GPA 3.78); certifications. Missing items: none critical (no degrees, employers, dates, or core technologies in the Actual Output are absent from the Retrieval Context). Fabricated/Contradicted items: none identified (no claims conflict with the retrieval).

212,1063,P1,10,9,7,40,"Punctuality: The score is 1.00 because the Contradictions list is empty, indicating no inconsistencies between the actual output and the retrieval context — nicely aligned and fully faithful.
Tone: Professionalism: well-formatted, grammatically strong, and polished overall with a clear header, sectioning, and concise bullets; minor wording/jargon (e.g., “agentic,” “5× faster feedback loops”) could be clarified. Action-Oriented: a major strength — numerous active verbs and measurable achievements (1M+ records processed, real-time QuickSight dashboards, ~5% accuracy improvement, ~8% toxicity reduction, 60% faster apply time, 96% cohort graduation) that demonstrate impact. Persona Alignment: generally well-aligned to a solutions-architect/AI engineer persona with strong AWS, SageMaker, and pipeline experience, though the broad web-dev emphasis (React/Node) slightly dilutes a pure architecture focus. Overall the resume is strong, with action-orientation as the relative strength and minor clarity/focus issues as the main weaknesses.
Alignment: The resume matches many core technical requirements: React and Node.js are explicitly listed in Core Skills and the summary (match for web app development), OAuth and Highcharts are named in skills (tool mentions but no project-level implementation), and Azure appears in Cloud Services plus an internship that configured/tested Azure environments (partial match for deployment). The resume also shows relevant outcomes and optimization experience (AWS reference architectures, a 1M+ record pipeline and ‘5× faster’ feedback loops) and Agile/CI-CD mention. Shortcomings: several must-haves are only surface-level mentions (OAuth, Highcharts) without concrete implementation/examples or Azure security/deployment ownership; most quantified achievements focus on AWS rather than the Azure/financial-services stack required; no financial-services experience and limited role-specific tailoring (some generic phrasing). Overall, required items are largely present but several are partial or misaligned, and tailoring to the Eliassen Azure/Highcharts/OAuth role is limited.
Impact: The resume uses strong action verbs and includes multiple clear, measurable achievements (e.g., automated sentiment pipeline processing 1M+ records with 5× faster feedback loops; SageMaker fine-tuning with ~5% accuracy gain and ~8% toxicity reduction; 36 lessons for 200+ learners with a 96% graduation rate; Alfred reducing time-to-apply by 60%; >100 tickets handled). These demonstrate accomplishment + metric + business outcome in several bullets. Shortcomings: several bullets remain vague or unmeasured (e.g., “Designed and presented secure, scalable AWS reference architectures,” “Configured and tested Azure environments,” API/vendor bullets) and a few generic/phrasal descriptions reduce clarity. Balanced against many strong metrics and active voice, the content scores highly but not perfect.
CredTail: Following the retrieval context: core items (degrees, employers, dates, AWS project specifics, certifications, contact info and LinkedIn) are accurately reflected — matched items include Master’s and Bachelor degrees with dates/GPA/honors, AWS Solutions Architect/WOPLLI/Mayor’s Office/RF CUNY roles with matching dates and highlights, Alfred project (FastAPI + OpenAI), and listed certifications. Fabricated claims (present in the Actual Output but not in the Retrieval Context) include React and Node.js, C#, PHP, Highcharts, and OAuth. Missing/omitted context details include the GitHub link, R programming, Docker/pgvector mention, DynamoDB and several specific AWS services (RDS, Macie) that appear in the Retrieval Context’s skill list. No critical items (degrees, employers, or dates) were omitted. Given multiple fabricated technology claims (larger credibility hits) and a few omitted technologies (smaller hits), the credibility score is reduced accordingly.",283,2025-12-19 00:02:09.43801,8,6

Tone: Professionalism: scored very high for formal, clear structure, complete contact info, polished summary and education/cert sections. Action-Oriented: scored very high for consistent strong verbs and measurable outcomes (e.g., sentiment-analysis pipeline processing 1M+ records with 5× faster feedback loops; SageMaker fine-tuning +5% accuracy/−8% toxicity; Alfred reduced application time 60% and increased weekly applications 300%; 96% cohort graduation). Persona Alignment: scored very high because cloud/AI tooling, AWS/Azure experience and relevant certifications match a solutions-architect/AI practitioner persona. All three dimension scores are equally strong, so there is no clear weak area or misalignment; averaged to the maximum composite score.
Alignment: The resume shows relevant cloud and NoSQL experience (AWS services including EC2, S3, Lambda, RDS, DynamoDB; AWS certifications; CI/CD; microservices) and includes measurable project outcomes (1M+ records pipeline, 5× faster feedback, 60% time reduction). However it fails major job requirements: the Oracle role expects a Principal/MTS with 10+ years and clear technical leadership — the candidate’s experience is internship-level (AWS intern, 2024–2025 internships) and lacks senior/lead responsibilities. Key required technologies are missing or underrepresented (no Java/Go/C# listing, no explicit TCP/IP or HTTP networking expertise, limited mention of distributed persistence/design for cloud-scale resilient services, and no frontend frameworks like React/Angular despite being listed in JD). The resume is also untailored to a senior Oracle cloud-engineering role and emphasizes AI/data projects rather than mission-critical, high-scale service operations. These substantial gaps justify a low alignment score.
Impact: Strong use of action verbs (designed, automated, fine-tuned) and many explicit metrics: 1M+ records, 5× faster feedback loops, +5% accuracy, −8% toxicity, −30% manual workload, 96% graduation rate, −60% application time, +300% weekly applications. Several bullets tie actions to concrete outcomes (faster feedback loops, model performance gains, workload reduction, higher application throughput). Deductions: some statements are vague/passive or lack quantification (e.g., “enhancing reliability and compliance,” “ensuring compliance,” “enhancing organizational security posture”), so not every bullet fully attributes business impact. Overall strong metrics and outcomes but minor issues with passive/vague claims.
CredTail: All critical items in the Actual Output are supported by the Retrieval Context: both degrees (Master of Science – Data Science and Machine Learning, expected Jan 2026; Bachelor of Technology – Computer Information Systems, Jun 2024) and listed honors/GPA appear.

Tone: High professionalism: clean, well-formatted resume with correct grammar and clear headings. Strong action-orientation: uses action verbs and several quantified impacts (e.g., “1M+ records,” “improving accuracy by ~5%/reducing toxicity by ~8%,” “Reduced application time by 60%,” “boosted weekly applications by 300%”). Persona alignment is good for a cloud/software engineering role and mentions tailoring to Eliassen Group, but it lacks explicit financial-services domain language (risk/compliance/finance-specific metrics), so slightly lower. No score differs by 2+ points, so no notable mismatch.
Alignment: The resume explicitly lists React, Node.js, Azure, OAuth, and Highcharts in the Professional Summary and Core Skills and shows Azure configuration experience at WOPLLI Technologies (explicit matches). However, React/Node experience is not demonstrated in concrete project or work responsibilities (partial), Highcharts/OAuth lack project-level evidence (partial), and senior-level responsibilities are missing—experience is internship-focused with no mention of code reviews or leading feature design (absent). Financial services/front-office domain experience is not shown (absent). The resume is partially tailored (it calls out contributing to Eliassen Group’s financial services solutions) but still uses some generic language and lacks senior/production delivery details, so the alignment is moderate.
Impact: Multiple bullets contain strong metrics and clear business impact (e.g., fine-tuned SageMaker models: ~5% accuracy improvement and ~8% toxicity reduction; sentiment pipeline processing 1M+ records; project: 60% reduction in application time and 300% increase in weekly applications; 96% cohort graduation rate). However, many bullets lack quantified results or explicit business outcomes (e.g., “Designed secure, scalable AWS architectures,” “Developed a Virtual Credential System,” and several WOPLLI bullets have no metrics), and a few phrases are vague/replaceable (“deliver actionable insights,” “managed relations”). Per the evaluation steps (count of fully-specified bullets, presence of metric+outcome per bullet, and minor penalties for vague language), this aligns with the 7–8 band, so the score reflects multiple strong, measurable bullets but notable gaps in consistency across the resume.
CredTail: Verified high-weight items: both degrees (MS Data Science & Machine Learning, expected Jan 2026; B.Tech Computer Information Systems, Jun 2024) match the Retrieval Context (GPA/honors matched).

Many core technologies are corroborated (Python; AWS: EC2/S3/Lambda/Bedrock/SageMaker; Azure App Service/Functions/Storage; QuickSight/Power BI; PostgreSQL/MySQL/Oracle/MongoDB/DynamoDB; Docker, Postman, Git; SIEM/Active Directory/Linux). Missing or unverified items: React and Node.js, Highcharts, and OAuth are claimed in the Actual Output but are not present in the Retrieval Context (treated as omissions/fabrications per step 2). No direct conflicts were found (no contradictory dates or degree claims). Because all high-weight items (degrees, employers, dates) are fully consistent but several core-technology claims are unsupported, I apply a moderate deduction and assign a score reflecting strong overall fidelity with some notable omissions.",285,2025-12-19 00:03:46.305945,8,8

Alignment: Extracted key requirements: cross-functional collaboration; custom UIs; code quality/performance optimization; technical leadership/mentorship and driving org-level change; architecting scalable systems and reducing technical debt; multi-language experience; component ownership; plus minimums (Bachelor’s degree, 8+ years programming or PhD-equivalent, demonstrated leadership, data-driven analysis) and preferred (C/C++/Java, strong testing/rollout/monitoring, 6+ years infra). Actual resume strengths: clear AWS/cloud infrastructure experience (EC2, S3, Lambda, Glue, SageMaker, Bedrock), Python and data/ML tooling, containerization/CI-CD, APIs, demonstrable project metrics (1M+ records pipeline, 5× faster feedback, model accuracy/toxicity improvements, 60% faster apply), ownership of projects (Alfred), and a Bachelor’s degree. Shortcomings vs job: candidate is early-career (intern roles) and does not meet the 8+ years or 6+ years infra experience; limited evidence of leading org-level initiatives or mentoring at scale; no explicit front-end/custom UI work; lacks explicit C/C++/Java experience and limited evidence of formal code-review/rollout/monitoring practices at production scale; no Meta-specific or senior title alignment. Given several strong technical matches but critical gaps on seniority, leadership, and some preferred tech, the resume partially aligns with the role.
Impact: Strong presence of clear action verbs with explicit, measurable outcomes across multiple bullets (e.g., automated sentiment pipeline processing 1M+ records with 5× faster feedback loops; SageMaker fine-tuning improving accuracy ~5% and reducing toxicity ~8%; Alfred project cutting application time by 60% and boosting applications 300%; refurbished 800+ devices; 96% cohort graduation). Language is mostly active and outcomes are business-relevant. Deduction applied because several bullets remain vague or lack numeric impact (e.g., “designed and presented AWS reference architectures,” vendor management, and some instructional/diagram tasks), so not every bullet meets the highest specificity standard.

Tone: Action-oriented strength: the output uses clear verbs and measurable outcomes (e.g., restored 400+ devices; scripts improved troubleshooting speed by 30%; 96% graduation rate; web app processing 65,000+ records), which demonstrates results focus. Professionalism is strong—organized headers, concise bullets, GPA and certifications listed—but minor polish issues (all-caps name header, occasional vague phrasing like “white glove service”) slightly reduce formality. Persona alignment is good: technical skills (Python, R, SQL, AWS), relevant certifications, and project examples match data/IT roles, though the mix of IT support/instruction and an in-progress MSc (expected Dec 2025) may modestly dilute fit for a senior data-scientist target. Overall, the output is well-written and results-driven, with action-orientation as the strongest dimension and minor professionalism/persona polish as the weakest areas.
Alignment: Mostly misaligned. The resume shows some matching technical skills (Python, R, SQL, database design, cloud) and quantifiable project stats (65k records, device restorations), but it lacks core senior business-analyst responsibilities from the job: no 5+ years of commercial business analysis, not from a 985/211 or senior internet/tech background, and experience is internship/volunteer-level rather than multiple mature project deliveries or 0→1 project ownership. Required tools are only partially present — SQL and Python/R appear, but Excel and mainstream BI tools are not listed. Outcomes and impact focus on operational/educational metrics rather than strategic business insights, cross-departmental leadership, or evidence of driving business decisions and database solutions for business digitalization. Language is generic and junior-focused rather than tailored to a Senior Data Analyst role, so overall alignment is very low.
Impact: Strong use of action verbs and multiple clear metrics (e.g., restored 400+ devices; deployed scripts improving troubleshooting speed by 30%; delivered 36 lessons to 200+ learners with a 96% graduation rate; tracking systems ↑ engagement 40%; features ↑ UX 25%; web app processed 65,000+ records) which tie to operational efficiency, user outcomes, and accessibility. Shortcomings: several bullets remain vague or unquantified (""white glove service"" with no satisfaction metric, ""research... influencing project direction"" without impact, ""ensuring data integrity"" and customization claims lack numeric outcomes) and a few soft/ambiguous phrases reduce clarity of business impact.

Tone: Professionalism: Highly polished resume with formal language, clean formatting, and correct grammar (contact links, clear sections). Action-Oriented: Strong use of active verbs and measurable achievements (e.g., “1M+ records,” “5× faster feedback loops,” “improving accuracy by ~5%,” “reducing toxicity by ~8%,” “96% cohort graduation rate”), showing clear accomplishment focus. Persona Alignment: Tone, vocabulary, and emphasis align well with a solutions-focused technologist/solutions architect (AWS/Bedrock/SageMaker experience, agentic AI project ‘Alfred,’ relevant certifications). All three categories are strengths with no notable weaknesses, yielding the highest aggregate score when averaged and mapped to the 0–10 scale.
Alignment: I followed the evaluation steps: extracted must-have items (Master’s degree, 3+ years’ relevant experience, 3 years coding in PHP/Hack/Python/C++, conducting design/code reviews, building large-scale infrastructure, component ownership, shipping high-quality/reliable work, and using data/analysis) and other responsibilities (design backend components, interface with teams, improve scalability/stability). Resume strengths: explicit Python/PHP/C++ listing, AWS architecture and scalable pipeline experience (1M+ records, 5× faster), data-driven improvements (accuracy +5%, toxicity -8%), and clear ownership of projects (Alfred, virtual credential system). Partial matches: interface with teams (vendor management), scalable designs, and use of data/analysis. Key shortcomings: does not currently hold the required Master’s (MS expected 2026), no explicit Hack experience, no evidence of 3+ years’ relevant work or conducting design/code reviews, and most experience is internship/project-level rather than large-scope production ownership. I penalized generic/senior-level omissions and lack of explicit code-review and Hack experience despite some quantified results. Based on the percent of required items matched (~half as full/partial matches) and downward adjustments for missing critical qualifications and senior scope, the resume scores below the midpoint for a direct match to this Meta Infrastructure role.
Impact: Strong use of action verbs and several concrete, measurable outcomes across bullets (e.g., automated pipeline processing 1M+ records, 5× faster feedback loops, ~5% accuracy improvement and ~8% toxicity reduction, 36 lessons for 200+ learners with a 96% graduation rate, and 100+ tickets supported). These provide clear accomplishments and business impact. Minor shortcomings: a few bullets remain vague or lack numeric outcomes (e.g., “designed and presented secure, scalable AWS reference architectures,” vendor management and some project descriptions), so small deductions for inconsistent metric coverage and occasional generic phrasing.

Tone: High professionalism: clean, well-structured Markdown resume with clear contact links, consistent headings and good grammar. Strong action-orientation: abundant action verbs and quantified impact (e.g., “1M+ records”, “5× faster feedback loops”, “improving accuracy by ~5%/reducing toxicity ~8%”, “60% time reduction”, “300% increase”), demonstrating measurable outcomes. Strong persona alignment: cloud/backend/ML focus (AWS, SageMaker, FastAPI, microservices) and explicit Meta-focused summary, matching a software/solutions engineering role. No notable score mismatches across categories.
Alignment: Resume explicitly matches several technical requirements: lists PHP, Python, and C++ in Core Skills and Professional Summary; describes large-scale infra work (AWS reference architectures, a sentiment pipeline processing 1M+ records with 5× faster feedback) and uses data/analysis (model tuning, dashboards). It partially matches ownership and design/code-review expectations (claims proven ability and ownership in the summary but lacks concrete bullets showing conducted design/code reviews or long-term ownership of a component). Key minimum qualifications are absent: Hack is not mentioned, and the required Master’s + three years of experience is unmet (Master’s is in progress, expected Jan 2026; experience is internships and short-term roles). Some tailoring to Meta’s mission is present, but the resume lacks senior/ownership evidence and explicit review experience. These omissions and partials justify a mid-low alignment.
Impact: Multiple bullets contain clear, action-oriented metrics and business impact (e.g., automated pipeline processing 1M+ records with 5× faster feedback loops; fine-tuned SageMaker models improving accuracy ~5% and reducing toxicity ~8%; Alfred project reducing time-to-apply by 60% and increasing weekly applications by 300%; 96% cohort graduation for 200+ learners). These satisfy the requirement for multiple bullets with numeric metrics and explicit outcomes (step 1). However, several bullets lack quantifiable metrics or explicit business outcomes (e.g., “designed and presented secure architectures,” “built POCs,” Azure configuration, API testing scripts, vendor management), which per step 2 warrants proportional deductions. Language is largely active and specific, so only a minor penalty for a few somewhat vague phrases (step 3). Balancing the strong, well-measured bullets against the number of non-quantified bullets leads to a high rating but not perfect.
CredTail: Verified degrees (M.S. Data Science & ML — Expected Jan 2026; B.Tech CIS — Jun 2024) match the Retrieval Context. Verified employers and dates: Solutions Architect Intern at AWS (Jun 2025–Sep 2025), Software Developer Intern at WOPLLI (Jun 2024–Sep 2024), IT Support Intern at Mayor’s Office (Feb 2024–May 2024), IT Instructor Assistant (Feb 2022–Aug 2023) all present and consistent. Core technologies largely verified: Python, Java, JavaScript, SQL, AWS services (EC2, S3, Lambda, Glue, QuickSight, Bedrock, SageMaker), FastAPI, Docker, Postman, PostgreSQL, MySQL, Oracle, MongoDB, DynamoDB, SageMaker, R/analytics tools and CI/CD are present in the Retrieval Context. Missing/conflicting items: PHP and C++ are claimed in the Actual Output but are not present anywhere in the provided Retrieval Context (neither the structured profile nor artifacts list them). Because high-weight items (degrees, employers, dates) are fully consistent, only modest penalty applied for the absent core language claims. Final score reflects strong overall alignment with localized omissions for two programming languages.",290,2025-12-19 00:06:56.850699,9,8
219,682,P4,9.0625,8,4,34.0625,"Punctuality: The score is 0.91 because the actual output contains small but clear mismatches: it rounded the Bachelor’s honors GPA to 3.8 instead of the retrieval value 3.78; it misstates degree timing — the profile shows a Bachelor’s date of Jun 2024 and a Master’s expected graduation of Jan 2026, but the retrieval does not support an expected graduation of May 2024; and it misrepresents the IT Support Intern role at the Mayor’s Office of Information Services by listing it as Feb 2024–Present and labeling it as Volunteer, whereas the retrieval shows Feb 2024–May 2024 (ended) and does not support “Present” or the volunteer designation.
Tone: I gave a high score because the resume is professional and clear (well-structured sections, contact info and LinkedIn present) and uses strong, action-oriented verbs with measurable results (e.g., “Restored 400+ devices,” “processed 1M+ records,” “5x faster,” “96% graduation rate”). Technical persona alignment is strong — skills and tools (Java, Python, SQL, AWS, Power BI, SSIS) and solutions-focused language match the target technologist/company. Shortcomings: some bullets are vague (e.g., “reducing manual workload significantly” lacks a metric), and there’s a timeline inconsistency (Expected Graduation May 2024 vs. AWS internship dated Jun–Sep 2025) that reduces credibility. Scoring breakdown used: Professionalism 4/5, Action-Oriented 4/5, Persona Alignment 4/5 — average 4/5, mapped to an overall score of 8/10. The three dimensions are balanced with no major mismatch, though accuracy and specificity should be tightened.
Alignment: Resume shows solid tool overlap with several mandatory items (SSIS, SSRS, Power BI, SQL, C#, .NET, and mentions robotic process automation) and provides quantitative outcomes (1M+ records processed, 5x speedup, 400+ devices restored). However it omits many required technologies from the job (no SSAS, no IIS Server, no SFTP mention, no explicit REST/SOAP or JSON/XML details, no Okta/Workato or Visual Studio 2022), and lacks the required seniority/education (only a bachelor’s in progress and internship/volunteer roles rather than 3+ years of senior IT development). Language is relatively generic and not tailored to the Touro University Senior ETL role. These strengths and gaps yield a below‑mid alignment score.
Impact: Strong use of action verbs and multiple measurable metrics (e.g., restored 400+ devices; delivered 36 lessons to 200+ learners with a 96% graduation rate; processed 1M+ records and achieved 5x faster feedback; used 65,000+ records in a web app). Timeframes and role dates are included. Shortcomings: several bullets use vague or passive language and lack concrete business impact or financial/cost/revenue outcomes (e.g., “enhancing operational efficiency,” “reducing manual workload significantly,” “improving student engagement” without quantification). Overall good metric coverage but inconsistent linkage to clear business value and some non-specific phrasing.
CredTail: Many core items are supported: name, email, LinkedIn URL, New York location, bachelor degree (CUNY NYC College of Technology) with similar GPA/expected graduation, AWS Solutions Architect Intern (dates and highlights match), IT Instructor Assistant (dates and metrics match), and the two listed certifications. Discrepancies/fabrications: the Mayor’s Office role in Actual shows Feb 2024–Present and “restored 400+ devices,” but Retrieval lists Feb 2024–May 2024 and 800+ devices (date and count mismatch); C# appears in Actual core skills but is not present in the structured core_skills (only supported indirectly in the artifact text for .NET/Java); two projects in Actual (Financial Stocks Report, EzRental) are not present in the Retrieval Context; phone numbers conflict in the structured profile (347-491-2955) vs artifact (929-305-7353) though the artifact supports the Actual number. Because most high‑priority items (education, AWS internship, instructor role, certifications) are supported but there are multiple invented/altered details (dates, device counts, missing projects, one tech), the output is partially faithful with notable fabrications.",356,2025-12-19 00:09:33.523736,7,6

Tone: Professionalism 4/5 — Resume is well-formatted, formal, and polished with clear sections and consistent bullets; minor issues (inconsistent tense usage, small wording/typo like “Postgre” and some duplicated competencies) prevent a perfect score. Action-Oriented 5/5 — Strong use of action verbs and measurable outcomes throughout (e.g., automated pipeline processing 1M+ records, 5× faster feedback loops, ~5% accuracy improvement and ~8% toxicity reduction, Alfred project: 60% faster applications and 300% more weekly applications). Persona Alignment 5/5 — Excellent fit for solutions-architect/data-science/generative-AI roles with specific AWS (Bedrock, SageMaker, Glue, Athena), LLM, CI/CD, FastAPI, and ETL experience. Average = (4 + 5 + 5) / 3 = 4.67. Highest: Action-Oriented & Persona Alignment (tied). Lowest: Professionalism. Overall alignment strong given quantified achievements and role-specific technical depth, so final score reflects that strength but notes small polish issues.
Alignment: Resume aligns well with many Meta Product Engineer requirements: shows a Bachelor’s degree, multiple relevant internships (AWS, WOPLLI), and concrete software work (FastAPI, Python, REST APIs, CI/CD, Docker, microservices). It demonstrates building large-scale infra and analytics (AWS reference architectures, POC pipelines processing 1M+ records, 5× faster feedback loops) and relational DB/SQL experience (Postgre, MySQL, Oracle). It also includes quantified outcomes (accuracy +5%, toxicity −8%, 60% time reduction, 300% application increase). Shortcomings: it does not explicitly show coding coursework or projects in one of the required languages (C, C++, Java, or C#) nor clear implementation of web interfaces with JavaScript/HTML/CSS, and it lacks an explicit statement of test coverage or adherence to internal release standards. Given strong matches across core cloud, backend, and data requirements but missing some listed language/UI/test specifics, the resume mostly fits the job.
Impact: Strong use of action verbs and multiple explicit metrics (e.g., “processed 1M+ records,” “5× faster feedback loops,” “~5% accuracy improvement / ~8% toxicity reduction,” “refurbished 800+ devices,” “96% cohort graduation,” “60% time reduction / 300% increase in weekly applications,” “36 lessons for 200+ learners”) demonstrates clear measurable results and business impact, satisfying steps 1–2. Shortcomings: several bullets remain vague or metricless (e.g., “Designed and presented secure, scalable AWS reference architectures,” “Produced data-flow and architecture diagrams,” “Managed relations with 3rd-party vendors,” some internship tasks), which reduces overall precision. Language is largely active (few passive issues), so only a moderate penalty is applied. Overall, high specificity but not universally quantified, so a score near the top is warranted.
CredTail: Verified items: personal info (name, location, email, phone, LinkedIn, GitHub); summary; core competencies (Python, SQL/NoSQL, AWS services including EC2/S3/Lambda/RDS/DynamoDB/Glue/QuickSight/Bedrock/Macie/SageMaker, Azure, ETL, Generative AI, QuickSight/Power BI, Security, Docker, Git, databases listed), all four work experiences with employers, titles, locations and exact dates (AWS Solutions Architect Intern Jun 2025–Sep 2025; WOPLLI Jun 2024–Sep 2024; Mayor’s Office Feb 2024–May 2024; RF CUNY & Generation USA Feb 2022–Aug 2023), project “Alfred” and its claims, education (MS expected Jan 2026; BS Jun 2024) and certifications. Missing items: no missing critical items (degrees, employers, dates, or core technologies are present). Minor, non‑critical omissions vs Retrieval Context: project tech list in the structured data includes PostgreSQL+pgvector and explicit Google Generative AI / OpenAI GPT-4.1 mini references that the Actual Output summarizes differently (GPT-4 Mini / not listing pgvector explicitly). Fabricated/Contradicted items: none found. Score justification: nearly all claims in the Actual Output are directly verified against the Retrieval Context, with no contradictions and only minor non‑critical omissions, so the highest credibility score is warranted.",252,2025-12-19 00:10:01.11199,8,10

Tone: High-quality, professional resume: polished language, correct grammar, and clear formatting (Professionalism scored high). The output is action-oriented with many active verbs and measurable achievements (e.g., “automated a sentiment-analysis pipeline processing 1M+ records,” “5× faster feedback loops,” “improving accuracy by ~5%,” “reducing toxicity by ~8%”), supporting an action-focused score. Tone, vocabulary, and emphasis align well with a data/solutions-architect persona—technical skills (Python, SQL, AWS), cloud projects (Bedrock, SageMaker, QuickSight), and outcome-driven metrics reinforce persona fit. All three categories are strengths with no clear weaknesses, yielding a top aggregated score.
Alignment: I extracted the job checklist (must-haves: collect/clean/analyze data; create/maintain reports & visualizations; provide insights/recommendations; maintain data quality via audits/checks; learn/apply analysis tools; participate in team meetings; qualifications: currently pursuing Data Science-related degree, strong analytical skills, teamwork/communication). The resume explicitly matches most items: Python/SQL/R, pandas/scikit-learn, ETL/ELT and AWS tools (tooling match); QuickSight and Power BI dashboards and a 1M+ record sentiment pipeline with 5× faster feedback (visualization/reporting + quantified outcomes); actionable sentiment insights and model fine-tuning (insights + measurable improvements). Education shows an in-progress MS in Data Science (qualification matched). Partial/missing: no explicit mention of regular data audits/checks or “help maintain data quality” as an explicit recurring task (summary claims data quality but no clear audits/processes), and a few generic summary phrases remain. Based on ~90% of required items matched with strong, quantified results, and a minor shortfall on explicit audit/process language, I rate this a high-score fit.
Impact: The resume uses strong action verbs and includes several clear measurable outcomes (e.g., automated sentiment pipeline processing 1M+ records, 5× faster feedback loops, ~5% accuracy improvement and ~8% toxicity reduction; 36 lessons for 200+ learners with a 96% graduation rate; project reduced time-to-apply by 60%; GPAs and certification details). These align well with steps 1–2. Shortcomings: several bullets lack specific metrics or business outcomes (WOPLLI bullets, IT Support’s “reduced manual workload” and “excellent service reviews” are vague, and some items use participation/passive phrasing like “Participated in cybersecurity training”), which warrants a penalty per step 3. Overall, multiple strong, quantified accomplishments but some inconsistent quantification across bullets, so the output scores highly but not perfect.
CredTail: The Actual Output closely follows the Retrieval Context: personal info, LinkedIn/GitHub links, all education entries (degrees, institutions, dates, GPAs, honors), employers and employment dates for AWS, WOPLLI, Mayor’s Office, and RF CUNY/Generation USA, project description (Alfred), and listed certifications are all present and accurately reflected. No fabricated claims were found. Omissions: several core technologies and specifics from the context are left out (e.g., PyTorch, seaborn, DynamoDB, Macie, detailed DB list like Postgre/Oracle/MySQL/MongoDB, and some project tech such as PostgreSQL+pgvector, Google Generative AI, CI/CD/assessment framework details). Some experience highlights from retrieval are also omitted (Virtual Credential System and Azure config under WOPLLI; CrowdStrike/log monitoring, device refurbishing/ServiceNow under Mayor’s Office; additional teaching materials under IT Instructor). Because there are no fabrications and critical items (degrees, employers, dates) are intact, only minor deductions were made for omitted technologies and detail-level highlights.",293,2025-12-19 00:10:36.726705,8,8

Tone: Well-formatted and professional: clean headings, contact links, consistent bullets and no notable grammar issues. Strongly action-oriented: uses active verbs and many quantified impacts (e.g., automated pipeline processing 1M+ records, 5× faster dashboards, model accuracy +~5%, toxicity -8%, 60% time reduction, 300% increase in applications). Good persona alignment for a Data Analyst Intern with Python/SQL/visualization skills and relevant projects, though the resume leans somewhat toward AWS/solutions-architect and generative-AI work which slightly shifts focus from a pure analyst role. No single category is markedly lower than the others.
Alignment: Strong alignment: the resume explicitly matches core qualifications and many responsibilities — MSc in Data Science in progress (Education), explicit proficiency in Python/SQL/R and visualization tools QuickSight and Power BI (Core Skills), ETL tools Glue/SSIS (Core Skills), and an AWS internship that built an automated sentiment-analysis pipeline processing 1M+ records and surfaced real-time QuickSight dashboards (Experience) which maps to collecting/cleaning/analyzing data, building visualizations, and supporting data-driven decisions. Partial or absent items: regular data-quality audits/checks are not detailed (no audit bullet), team-meeting/ongoing report maintenance and collaborative examples are only implied (collaboration listed but limited concrete examples), and most internships are cloud/engineering-focused rather than explicitly titled Data Analyst experience. Minor penalty for some generic phrasing, though the Professional Summary explicitly references CityWonders. Overall several strong explicit matches with a few important partials/omissions, so a high-but-not-perfect score is warranted.
Impact: The resume contains several strong, action-oriented bullets with clear metrics and impact (notably: the AWS pipeline processing 1M+ records with 5× faster feedback loops; SageMaker fine-tuning improving accuracy ~5% and reducing toxicity ~8%; Alfred project reducing time-to-apply by 60% and increasing applications 300%; 96% cohort graduation rate; white‑glove support for 100+ tickets). I counted about five fully-specified bullets out of 13, while many bullets (e.g., WOPLLI entries, several AWS and IT Support bullets) lack quantifiable metrics or explicit business outcomes. Across all bullets there are roughly 13 missing metric/outcome elements (out of 39 possible), and several items use vague phrasing like “designed” or “configured” without stated impact. I applied proportional deductions for missing elements and a small penalty for vague language when determining the score.
CredTail: Verified items: both degrees match the Retrieval Context (Master of Science – Data Science and Machine Learning, CUNY SPS, Expected Jan 2026; Bachelor of Technology – Computer Information Systems, CUNY NYC College of Technology, Jun 2024). Employers and dates match for all listed roles (Solutions Architect Intern, AWS, Jun 2025–Sep 2025; Software Developer Intern, WOPLLI, Jun 2024–Sep 2024; IT Support Intern, Mayor’s Office, Feb 2024–May 2024; IT Instructor Assistant, Feb 2022–Aug 2023). Core technologies claimed in the Actual Output are present in the Retrieval Context (Python with pandas/scikit-learn, SQL, R, QuickSight, Power BI, AWS services including EC2/S3/Lambda/Glue/Bedrock/SageMaker, Azure, SSIS). Contact info and links (email, phone, LinkedIn, GitHub), certifications, and the Alfred project are all consistent. Missing/conflicting items: none material detected; no fabricated employers, dates, degrees, or major technologies found.

Tone: I rated Professionalism 4/5: the output is well structured, formal, and clear (contact, summary, skills, education, certifications), but has minor issues such as inconsistent timeline wording (expected degrees/dates) and some generic phrasing. I rated Action-Oriented 4/5: several bullets use strong verbs and measurable outcomes (taught 36 lessons to 200+ learners with a 96% graduation rate; restored 400+ devices), but other entries are vague (e.g., “enhancing system performance” without metrics). I rated Persona Alignment 3/5: content aligns broadly with a tech/data persona (Java, Python, AWS, 4.0 MS GPA, certifications), yet it feels generic rather than tailored to a specific company/role and timeline inconsistencies could harm fit. Average of the three is ~3.67/5, mapped to an overall score of 7/10. Strongest dimensions: Professionalism and Action-Oriented; weakest: Persona Alignment due to lack of company-specific tailoring and timeline inconsistencies.
Alignment: The resume shows no meaningful alignment with the Registered Nurse role at Encompass Health. The Input is a clinical nursing position (hospital RN, patient-care responsibilities, night shift 7P–7A, benefits/clinical context) but the Actual Output is a technology-focused CV (Java, Python, SQL, AWS/Azure, ETL, software dev, IT support roles) with no clinical skills, licenses, EMR experience, medication administration, or nursing metrics. While the resume includes quantifiable outcomes (96% graduation rate, 400+ devices restored), they are unrelated to nursing. The response is therefore entirely untailored to the job and scores at the bottom of the scale.
Impact: The resume contains several clear action verbs and measurable metrics (e.g., “taught 36 lessons to 200+ learners, achieving 96% graduation rate”; “restored 400+ devices”; GPAs 4.0 and 3.8), which satisfies Step 1. However, only the graduation metric is strongly tied to an outcome; the device restoration bullet claims “enhancing operational efficiency” but lacks quantified impact (Step 2). Multiple bullets are vague or generic without metrics or concrete business outcomes (e.g., “Developed technical documentation,” “Collaborated on application design, enhancing system performance,” “Developed API integrations, streamlining data flow”), and some phrasing leans on non-specific descriptors rather than measurable results (Step 3). Overall, there are useful metrics but inconsistent linkage to business impact and several passive/vague items, so the evaluation falls in the mid range.
CredTail: Personal/contact info and most core technologies are supported verbatim (name, email, phone, New York location; Java/Python/SQL; AWS, Azure; PostgreSQL, MySQL, Oracle; ETL/ELT; Agile/SDLC/CI/CD). Two experiences align well with the retrieval context: IT Instructor Assistant (RF CUNY) with Feb 2022–Aug 2023, 36 lessons and 96% graduation, and Software Developer Intern at WOPLLI Technologies Jun 2024–Sep 2024. Key discrepancies: the Mayor’s Office role is inconsistent—retrieval lists IT Support Intern Feb 2024–May 2024 with ~800 devices refurbished and 100+ white‑glove tickets, while Actual claims “Volunteer IT Support and Development Intern” Feb 2024–Current and “restored 400+ devices” (date and device-count mismatches are fabricated/inaccurate). A major omission from Actual is the Solutions Architect Intern role at Amazon Web Services (Jun 2025–Sep 2025) present in the retrieval. Education is mostly supported (Master’s matches; Bachelor’s date and GPA differ slightly: Jun 2024 and 3.78 vs Actual May 2024 and 3.8). Certifications partially match (AWS Solutions Architect and Google Cybersecurity present; two additional retrieval certs omitted). Given most core items are supported but with significant employer/date/metric mismatches and one major omitted employer, I deduct points for those fabricated/missing critical details and assign a moderate credibility score.",360,2025-12-19 00:12:53.809558,6,6

Tone: Professionalism: well-structured, grammatically clean, and polished with clear headings and contact info, though use of Markdown-style links and minor formatting choices (e.g., inline Markdown, email capitalization) could reduce ATS/readability. Action-oriented: excellent — frequent action verbs and multiple quantified impacts (e.g., 1M+ records processed, 5× faster feedback loops, ~5% accuracy gain, ~8% toxicity reduction, 96% graduation rate) that demonstrate measurable results. Persona alignment: tightly matched to cloud/solutions-architect and data-engineering roles with AWS/Azure, microservices, data pipeline, and SageMaker experience; only small mismatch is the explicit Oracle-targeted sentence while most experience highlights AWS. Overall scores are consistent with no large outlier across categories.
Alignment: The resume explicitly matches several core JD items: Java and Python proficiency (Core Skills), microservices and service-to-service communication (Core Skills), AWS/Azure cloud experience and an AWS Solutions Architect internship that cites designing scalable reference architectures and an automated pipeline processing 1M+ records (Experience). It also has the required degree (Bachelor’s) and relevant certifications. Key shortcomings: the JD requires 3+ years of software development — the Actual Output shows mostly internships and teaching roles (dates indicate limited professional tenure), so that requirement is effectively absent. Leadership/mentorship in an engineering context is only partially supported (teaching/summary claims but no senior engineering lead role). Oracle Cloud experience and IDE experience (Eclipse/IntelliJ) from Preferred Qualifications are absent, and long-running production/operator experience for highly reliable cloud services is only partially demonstrated. Given several partials and a major absent item (experience years), plus minor tailoring/generic language issues, the alignment is moderate.
Impact: The resume includes multiple strong, action-oriented bullets with measurable results and clear impact (notably AWS intern: “Automated a sentiment-analysis pipeline processing 1M+ records” with “5× faster feedback loops,” and “Fine-tuned models… improving accuracy ~5% and reducing toxicity ~8%”; and Instructor Assistant: “36 lessons…200+ learners” and “96% cohort graduation rate”), which satisfy the requirement for numeric metrics and business outcomes. Shortcomings: many bullets lack quantification or explicit outcomes (several WOPLLI bullets and IT Support bullets provide tasks but no metrics or clear business impact), and a few items are vague (e.g., “Designed and presented secure, scalable AWS reference architectures” and generic vendor/API statements). I penalized for the uneven distribution of fully-specified bullets and some weak/vague phrasing, leaving a strong but not perfect alignment with the evaluation criteria.
CredTail: Strong consistency: all high-weight items match the Retrieval Context — degrees (M.S. Data Science & ML expected Jan 2026; B.Tech Computer Information Systems Jun 2024) and employers with dates (Solutions Architect Intern at AWS Jun 2025–Sep 2025; Software Developer Intern WOPLLI Jun 2024–Sep 2024; IT Support Intern Mayor’s Office Feb 2024–May 2024; IT Instructor Assistant RF CUNY & Generation USA Feb 2022–Aug 2023) are present and identical. Most core technologies and skills are verified (Python with pandas/scikit-learn/PyTorch; AWS services including EC2, S3, Lambda, RDS, DynamoDB, Glue, Bedrock, SageMaker, QuickSight; Azure App Service/Functions; ETL/ELT Glue & SSIS; Postman; CI/CD; Microservices; SIEM/IDS/Active Directory/Linux). Missing/unverified items: Java is claimed in the Actual Output but is not listed in the Retrieval Context; leadership/mentoring assertions in the summary are not explicitly supported by the artifacts. Deductions reflect a single notable fabrication/omission (Java) and a minor unsupported claim (leadership), while all high-weight items (degrees, employers, dates, major cloud technologies) remain fully consistent — this justifies a high but not perfect credibility score.",300,2025-12-19 00:14:47.697233,8,9

Tone: Professionalism: 5 — polished formatting, clear sections, good grammar, and strong details (contact, education, certifications). Action-Oriented: 5 — uses active verbs and measurable achievements (e.g., “Automated a sentiment-analysis pipeline processing 1M+ records,” “5× faster feedback loops,” “improving accuracy by ~5%,” “reducing toxicity by ~8%,” “96% cohort graduation rate”). Persona Alignment: 5 — tone, vocabulary, and emphasis align with a cloud/data/solutions-architect persona (AWS services, Bedrock/SageMaker work, Alfred FastAPI + GPT integration). Average = 5.0. Relative strengths: consistent high polish, quantifiable outcomes, and tight alignment to the target technical role. Minor weakness: small contact omission (no phone number) and very slight over-detail in full street address that could be shortened for privacy; otherwise no substantive issues.
Alignment: I extracted 11 must-have items from the JD (architect/operate distributed systems; lead/mentor; build/maintain high-scale resilient services; drive iterative improvements; evaluate/recommend changes data-driven; 3+ years experience; proficiency in Java/Python; full SDLC experience; deep microservices knowledge; experience building reliable scalable services; Bachelor’s degree). The resume explicitly matches several technical must-haves: Java and Python listed, explicit microservices expertise, and a completed Bachelor’s. It also shows strong cloud tooling and measurable outcomes (AWS architectures, Glue/SageMaker/Bedrock work, an automated pipeline processing 1M+ records and 5× faster feedback loops, model improvements ~5% accuracy/8% toxicity), which supports partial matches for designing/operating scalable services, iterative improvements, and SDLC-related work. Shortcomings: leadership/mentorship experience and a senior title are absent (only internship roles and a generic “Technical Leadership” bullet), the resume likely falls short of the 3+ years experience requirement, and there’s no Oracle-specific cloud experience or mention of IDEs (preferred). Given roughly a 50% effective match of required items (several partials) and good quantified technical outcomes but weak senior-level evidence and limited tailoring to Oracle, the score reflects a mid-level alignment.
Impact: Resume shows many action verbs and several strong measurable bullets (e.g., automated pipeline processing 1M+ records with 5× faster feedback loops; SageMaker fine-tuning yielding ~5% accuracy gain and ~8% toxicity reduction; 36 lessons for 200+ learners and a 96% graduation rate). However multiple bullets lack numeric metrics or clear business outcomes (AWS reference architectures and POCs, several WOPLLI and IT Support bullets, the Alfred project) and some phrasing is vague/passive (e.g., “Participated,” “Managed relations”), so score is reduced to reflect mixed specificity and impact.
CredTail: Strengths: The Actual Output accurately reproduces the summary, employers, employment dates, education degrees/dates/honors, certifications, AWS services, and the Alfred project and its RAG/LLM focus from the Retrieval Context. Fabricated item: the Core Skills list adds “Java,” which is not present in the Retrieval Context. Missing items: the contact phone number (347-491-2955) is omitted; many core technologies from the Context are not listed (R, Power BI, Docker/containerization, PostgreSQL + pgvector, CI/CD/Git details, OpenAI/Google technos listed in tech stack); several experience highlights are omitted (CrowdStrike/log monitoring, refurbishing/tracking ~800 devices, ServiceNow asset management, “white glove” support/100+ tickets, produced data-flow/architecture diagrams and testing materials from other roles). Because employers, dates, degrees and major AWS/project details match but there is at least one fabricated core skill and multiple omitted technical and experience details, the credibility is substantially reduced.",298,2025-12-19 00:15:51.010154,7,2

Action-Oriented: excellent — frequent action verbs and quantified impacts (e.g., “1M+ records,” “5× faster,” “~5% accuracy,” “60% time reduction,” “300% increase”) that demonstrate measurable results. Persona Alignment: very good — tone and technical emphasis fit cloud/solutions-architecture roles and embedded engineering, though a single line referencing Robert Half feels slightly out of place for a general technical resume. No score is 2+ points below the others, so no major mismatch flagged.
Alignment: Explicit matches: resume clearly lists Linux-based systems and C++/.NET in the Professional Summary and Core Skills (explicit). Cloud, automation, and REST API experience are also explicit. Partial matches: embedded engineering is named in Summary/Core Skills but has no embedded-specific projects, hardware integrations, or quantified embedded outcomes (partial). Advanced software development/support is asserted (Summary, Alfred project) but evidence centers on cloud/ML internships and a web/AI project rather than embedded or production C++/.NET systems (partial). Absent/weak: senior/Sr. level and Subject Matter Expert track record — experience section shows internships and no senior lead role or SME responsibilities; contract/Brooklyn location and embedded deliverables are not demonstrated; concrete C++/.NET project results are missing. Penalties applied for generic claims like “Proven track record” unsupported by senior-level accomplishments. Overall, several critical senior/SME and embedded items are absent or only partial, so the alignment is moderate.
Impact: Multiple bullets present strong, measurable results and clear business impact (e.g., AWS sentiment pipeline processing 1M+ records with 5× faster feedback loops; SageMaker fine-tuning improving accuracy ~5% and reducing toxicity ~8%; Alfred project reducing time-to-apply by 60% and increasing weekly applications by 300%; 96% cohort graduation rate; 36 lessons for 200+ learners; 100+ tickets with excellent reviews). However, several bullets lack quantification or explicit outcomes (e.g., “Designed and presented secure, scalable AWS reference architectures,” WOPLLI internship bullets, and some IT support items), and a few use weaker verbs/activities (“configured and tested,” “developed API integration”) that limit clarity. Penalized slightly for those missing metrics/outcomes and minor passive/weak phrasing.
CredTail: Verified: degrees (MS Data Science & ML, expected Jan 2026; B.Tech CIS, Jun 2024) and honors (GPAs, Dean’s List, National Honor Society) are present in the Retrieval Context. All employers and dates are consistent (Solutions Architect Intern at AWS Jun 2025–Sep 2025; Software Developer Intern WOPLLI Jun 2024–Sep 2024; IT Support Intern Mayor’s Office Feb 2024–May 2024; IT Instructor Assistant Feb 2022–Aug 2023). Many core technologies claimed are supported (Python, SQL/NoSQL, AWS services including Bedrock/Glue/SageMaker/QuickSight, Azure App Service/Functions, FastAPI/Postman, Docker, QuickSight/Power BI, security items like SIEM/IDS/Active Directory). Missing/conflicting: C++ and “Embedded Engineering” are not listed in the structured core_skills (C++ is absent; .NET appears only in an Artifact cover-letter but is not in the core_skills list), and the resume’s statement about contributing to “Robert Half’s mission” is unsupported by the Retrieval Context (no Robert Half reference). Deductions: major items (degrees/employers/dates) fully match so credibility remains high, but unsupported skill claims and the fabricated organizational alignment reduce trust. Evidence-driven score reflects strong overall consistency with targeted penalties for the unsupported claims.",305,2025-12-19 00:18:17.016999,9,7
227,1057,P0,10,10,5,43,"Punctuality: The score is 1.00 because there are no contradictions (Contradictions: []) and the actual output fully aligns with the retrieval context — nice work.
Tone: Professionalism: strong formatting, clear sections, consistent bullets and good grammar; minor nitpick (e.g., “Postgre” appears truncated). Action-Oriented: excellent—frequent strong verbs (Designed, Built, Automated, Fine-tuned) and multiple quantified outcomes (1M+ records, 5× faster feedback loops, ~5% accuracy gain, ~8% toxicity reduction, 96% graduation rate, 60%/300% project improvements). Persona Alignment: very well matched to a cloud/AI/data solutions role with AWS (Bedrock, SageMaker, Glue), LLM/agent projects, ETL, and architecture experience. Computed average of the three criteria = 5.0; highest: Professionalism/Action-Oriented/Persona Alignment (all tied); lowest: same (all tied).
Alignment: Step 1 (requirements): Job requests a Senior Software Engineer for Pearson/LMS with engineering leadership, design/review/testing/deployment, mentor/teamwork, 5+ years building SaaS and highly available/concurrent web apps, familiarity with GitLab, AWS-hosted apps, Java/Spring Boot, ReactJS, MongoDB, and agile/process improvement. Step 2 (comparison): The resume explicitly matches AWS experience, MongoDB, Git/version control, CI/CD, containerization, microservices, Agile/Scrum, and some testing/automation (POCs, pipelines, GitHub Actions). It also shows quantified project outcomes (pipeline processing 1M+ records; 5× faster feedback loops; 60% time reduction). Implied/partial matches include mentoring (IT Instructor Assistant) and experience with APIs and production deployments. Major gaps: no evidence of 5+ years of professional SaaS development or senior-level engineering leadership; missing core stack elements required by Pearson (Java, Spring Boot, ReactJS) and no explicit GitLab experience; no clear evidence of building highly concurrent, mission-critical web applications or LMS/3rd-party LMS integration experience. Step 3 (specificity/relevance): Strengths are concrete metrics and relevant cloud/tool skills (AWS services, MongoDB, CI/CD). Shortcomings are role seniority mismatch, absent primary language/frameworks, and lack of GitLab and explicit mission-critical SaaS experience. Overall alignment is partial—several key company/title-specific requirements are unmet while several technical and measurable items are present.
Impact: Strong presence of clear action verbs plus explicit, measurable results in multiple bullets (e.g., “Automated a sentiment-analysis pipeline processing 1M+ records” with “5× faster feedback loops”; “Fine-tuned models… improving accuracy by ~5% and reducing toxicity by ~8%”; project metrics: 60% time reduction and 300% increase in weekly applications; 96% cohort graduation; 800+ devices refurbished). These demonstrate concrete business impact and multiple distinct metrics. Shortcomings: several bullets remain generic or lack numeric outcomes (e.g., “Designed and presented secure, scalable AWS reference architectures,” “Built POCs combining Bedrock…”) and some claims are vague, so I applied a modest deduction for inconsistent metric coverage and occasional non-specific impact statements.
CredTail: Verified items: both degrees (M.S.

Missing items: none critical (degrees, employers, dates, core technologies present). Fabricated/Contradicted items: none identified. Rationale: nearly every claim (degrees, employers, dates, and core technologies) is directly supported by the Retrieval Context, so no penalties apply under the rubric and the credibility is maximal under the evaluation steps.",262,2025-12-19 00:18:30.113883,8,10
228,1194,P1,9.512195121951219,9,4,32.51219512195122,"Punctuality: The score is 0.95 because the actual output mislabels the Mayor’s Office position as 'Volunteer' and gives dates 'Feb 2024 – Present' while the retrieval context shows an 'IT Support Intern' from Feb 2024 – May 2024, and it understates device work by saying 'over 400' when the context documents refurbishing and tracking over 800 devices.
Tone: Overall polished and professional resume: clear headings, correct grammar, concise summary, and relevant certifications and skills for a solutions-focused technologist (AWS, C++, Linux, FastAPI project). Action-oriented language is present with measurable achievements (restored over 400 devices, 96% cohort graduation rate, reduced application time by 60%), but several bullets remain generic or passive (e.g., “Provide support,” “Communicate effectively,” “Managed relations” without specifics), limiting impact. Persona alignment is strong—the tone, vocabulary, and emphasis match the target technologist role and career stage (MS expected Jan 2026, BTech Jun 2024, relevant internships and projects). Relative strengths: persona fit and measurable accomplishments; relative weakness: a few vague bullet points and minor consistency/formatting polish that prevent a perfect score.
Alignment: Checklist extracted: must-haves = Linux-based system development SME, embedded engineering background, expertise in C++ and .NET, ability to develop/support advanced software solutions; nice-to-have = Brooklyn/contract, senior title, specific embedded toolchains/RTOS. Resume matches: explicit Linux skills (Summary/Core Skills/teaching) = strong match; C++ and .NET listed in Core Skills = match but no evidence of using them in listed roles (partial); embedded engineering referenced in Summary but no concrete embedded projects or toolchain experience (partial); SME/senior-level experience and senior title are missing (no senior roles, only internships/volunteer) = missing; advanced software outcomes partly supported by quantified project impacts (400 devices restored, 96% graduation rate, 60% application time reduction) = positive. Tools present (Postman, FastAPI, PostgreSQL, AWS, Docker) but embedded-specific tools absent. Given ~50% of required items matched (many partials), plus strengths in quantified outcomes but significant shortcomings in senior/SME evidence and concrete embedded/C++/.NET experience, the resume scores low-moderate on fit for this Sr. Software Engineer role.
Impact: The response includes multiple strong action verbs and several clear, measurable achievements (e.g., restoring over 400 devices; delivering 36 lessons to 200+ learners; maintaining a 96% cohort graduation rate; reducing application time by 60% in the Alfred project), which supports a relatively high score. However, several bullets remain vague or passive (e.g., “Provide support,” “Participate in a project,” vendor management and API work without metrics or clear business impact), and not every bullet ties accomplishment+metric+business outcome together. Given the mix of concrete metrics and remaining generic phrasing, the output merits a moderately high score.
CredTail: The Actual Output includes many items that match the Retrieval Context (name, location, email, phone, LinkedIn, both degrees and dates—M.S. expected Jan 2026 and B.Tech Jun 2024—WOPLLI Technologies internship (Jun–Sep 2024), RF CUNY & Generation USA instructor role (Feb 2022–Aug 2023), the Alfred project (FastAPI + PostgreSQL + pgvector + LLMs), certifications, and core DB/CI/CD items like PostgreSQL, MySQL, Oracle, MongoDB, Docker, GitHub Actions). Discrepancies and fabrications: it adds C++ and “embedded engineering” (not present in the Context) and reports refurbishing “over 400” devices (Context says ~800) — fabricated/contradictory details. Critical missing/omitted items: the AWS Solutions Architect Intern role at Amazon (Jun 2025–Sep 2025) is omitted entirely, and several specific AWS services from Context (DynamoDB, Glue, QuickSight, Bedrock, SageMaker, Macie) and other listed technologies were not reflected. Date mismatch for the Mayor’s Office role (Actual: Feb 2024–Present vs Context: Feb 2024–May 2024) is a significant credibility issue. Given multiple fabricated details, a missing major employer/role, and key date discrepancies (with some smaller omitted technologies), the output’s credibility is substantially reduced.",303,2025-12-19 00:19:31.465521,7,3

Tone: Professionalism: well-structured, clear headings and mostly correct grammar, but resume uses a first-person sentence in the summary and has minor style inconsistencies (e.g., LinkedIn formatting and resume voice), slightly reducing polish. Action-Oriented: strong — many action verbs and quantified impacts (e.g., automated a pipeline processing 1M+ records, improved model accuracy by ~5% and toxicity by ~8%, reduced application time by 60% and increased applications by 300%), showing measurable outcomes. Persona Alignment: good fit for software/cloud roles with relevant vocabulary (C++, Linux, AWS, CI/CD, SageMaker) and targeted line about Robert Half, though the mix of embedded/Linux, data science, and support roles creates a mild focus trade-off. The three category ratings average to a high overall alignment with no category lagging by 2+ points.
Alignment: Extracted anchors: Linux-based systems, embedded engineering, C++, .NET, SME for Linux, developing/supporting advanced software. Resume explicitly mentions Linux, C++, .NET in the Professional Summary and Core Skills (explicit). CI/CD and automation outcomes are claimed in the summary and projects (explicit). However, embedded engineering evidence is only a high-level claim in the summary with no embedded-specific projects, RTOS, kernel, hardware, or cross-compilation work in Experience (absent/partial). Senior/SME level experience is not supported—Experience lists internships and cloud/support roles without senior or embedded deliverables (partial/absent). The resume is tailored to Robert Half in the summary (positive), but uses some generic language and lacks concrete senior-level/embedded achievements (penalty). Overall several explicit matches but key embedded and senior-role evidences are missing, yielding a mid alignment score.
Impact: Strong points: multiple bullets include clear numeric metrics and outcomes (AWS sentiment pipeline: 1M+ records and 5x feedback loop improvement; SageMaker tuning: ~5% accuracy gain and ~8% toxicity reduction; Alfred project: 60% faster apply time and 300% more weekly applications; Instructor role: 36 lessons for 200+ learners and 96% graduation). Shortcomings: several role bullets lack quantifiable metrics or explicit business impact (e.g., AWS architecture design, WOPLLI bullets, some Mayor’s Office items), and a few use vague/weak phrasing (""Designed,"" ""Developed,"" ""Configured"") that reduces actionability. Score reflects multiple strong, measurable bullets but meaningful gaps and some passive/vague language per the evaluation steps.

Core technologies largely match (Linux; AWS EC2/S3/Lambda; Azure; Docker; CI/CD; PostgreSQL/MySQL/Oracle/MongoDB; FastAPI; SageMaker; Postman) and certifications match. Missing/conflicting: no evidence in the Retrieval Context for C++ or JavaScript as claimed in Programming Languages; “embedded engineering” in the summary is not supported; the self-description as a “Senior Software Engineer” conflicts with an experience record comprised of internships. These unsupported claims reduce credibility but high-weight items (degrees, employers, dates, major tech/tooling) are consistent, so score is reduced moderately rather than heavily.",310,2025-12-19 00:22:04.573788,8,8

Tone: Professionalism: 4/5 — resume is well-structured, polished headings/contact links, consistent formatting and clear sectioning; minor punctuation/inconsistency and occasional redundancy reduce polish slightly. Action-Oriented: 5/5 — strong action verbs and many quantifiable results (processed 1M+ records, 5× faster feedback loops, ~5% accuracy gain / ~8% toxicity reduction, 60% time reduction, 300% increase in applications, 96% graduation rate). Persona Alignment: 4/5 — content, tooling (AWS: Bedrock, SageMaker, Athena/Glue/Lambda, QuickSight), generative AI focus and projects map well to a solutions-architect/data-science persona, though predominance of internship roles and some broad listings slightly temper seniority. Average = 4.33/5; strongest: Action-Oriented; weakest: Professionalism and Persona (tied).
Alignment: Evaluation used job requirements: port Python ML models into a C++ cross-platform SDK (iOS, Android, Linux, Windows), ensure high-performance inference, and bridge Python-to-C++ toolchains. The resume shows relevant ML skills (PyTorch, model fine-tuning in SageMaker), cloud and CI/CD experience, and quantified model improvements, which partially match model-development aspects. However it lacks explicit C++ experience, any mobile/iOS/Android or cross-platform SDK work, ONNX/TFLite/CoreML/TensorRT mentions, or examples of model porting and inference optimization—key responsibilities for this role—so several major requirements are missing.
Impact: Using the rubric, several bullets show strong alignment: clear actions plus numeric metrics and business impact (e.g., automated sentiment pipeline processing 1M+ records with 5× faster feedback loops; fine-tuned SageMaker models improving accuracy ~5% and reducing toxicity ~8%; IT Instructor Assistant delivered 36 lessons to 200+ learners with a 96% graduation rate; Alfred project reduced time-to-apply by 60% and increased weekly applications by 300%). However, multiple bullets (AWS reference architectures, POCs, WOPLLI and IT Support tasks) lack measurable outcomes or are vague/passive, which merited deductions per the penalize-passive step. The presence of multiple concrete metrics but several unclear bullets supports a strong but not perfect score.

Tone: Professionalism 4, Action-Oriented 5, Persona Alignment 5 → average 4.67/5. Strengths: polished formatting with contact links and clear sections, strong outcome-focused bullets with quantifiable results (e.g., “1M+ records,” “5× faster feedback loops,” “60% reduction,” “300% increase,” SageMaker improvements ~5% accuracy / ~8% toxicity), and excellent alignment to a Solutions Architect / ML-focused persona through explicit AWS services (Bedrock, SageMaker, Glue, Athena), CI/CD, containerization and a relevant project (Alfred). Shortcomings: minor polish issues (e.g., “Postgre” truncated in databases, occasional terse bullets) that slightly reduce overall professionalism. Highest criteria: Action-Oriented and Persona Alignment (tied). Lowest: Professionalism. Overall the resume is strong and merits a high score.
Alignment: Following the evaluation steps, the resume meets several Meta requirements: it shows a related bachelor’s degree, strong AWS and large-scale infrastructure experience (automated pipeline processing 1M+ records, 5× faster feedback), quantified ML outcomes (SageMaker fine-tuning: +5% accuracy, −8% toxicity), and solid database/SQL, ETL, CI/CD, and algorithms competencies. However, it fails to explicitly document several mandatory items from the job listing: no evidence of full‑stack web/mobile development in the listed languages (PHP/C/C++/Java/C#), no explicit JavaScript/HTML/CSS or React/React Native experience, and no clear statement of conducting design/code reviews or test coverage practices. Because key company/title-specific technical requirements (frontend framework and specified languages) are missing while many infrastructure and data requirements are well-supported and quantified, the alignment is partial rather than near-complete.
Impact: The resume contains multiple high-quality bullets with clear action verbs, numeric metrics, and business outcomes (e.g., automated sentiment pipeline processing 1M+ records with 5× faster feedback loops; reduced time-to-apply by 60% and increased weekly applications by 300%; fine-tuned SageMaker models improving accuracy ~5% and reducing toxicity ~8%; delivered 36 lessons to 200+ learners and maintained a 96% graduation rate; refurbished 800+ devices). These demonstrate specific actions plus measurable impact as prioritized in the evaluation steps. Shortcomings include several vague or metric-free bullets (e.g., “Designed and presented secure, scalable AWS reference architectures,” “Built POCs… to deliver actionable sentiment insights,” routine internship tasks) which reduce overall consistency. Given the strong prevalence of concrete metrics and business outcomes but some remaining non-measurable items, the output scores highly.
CredTail: All critical claims (personal info, employers, job titles, dates, project details, degrees, honors, and core technologies) in the Actual Output directly match items in the Retrieval Context. Verified examples include Solutions Architect Intern at AWS (Jun 2025–Sep 2025) with Bedrock/Athena/Glue/SageMaker work, Software Developer Intern at WOPLLI (Jun 2024–Sep 2024), IT Support Intern at Mayor’s Office (Feb 2024–May 2024), IT Instructor Assistant (Feb 2022–Aug 2023), the Alfred project tech stack (FastAPI, PostgreSQL+pgvector, OpenAI GPT-4.1 mini, google-genai), and education entries (MS expected Jan 2026; BS Jun 2024).

Tone: Professionalism: strong, well-structured resume with clear headings, correct grammar, and polished formatting. Action-Oriented: excellent — multiple quantified outcomes (processed over 1M records, 5× faster feedback-to-action, 5% accuracy gain, 8% toxicity reduction, 96% graduation rate) and impact-focused verbs. Persona Alignment: very well matched to a data-engineering/AWS solutions role — relevant tech stack (AWS Glue, Bedrock, SageMaker, SQL, Python, Snowflake), projects, and certifications reinforce the target persona. No score is 2+ points below the others, so no notable mismatch.
Alignment: The resume explicitly matches several technical requirements: Data Architecture and data engineering design patterns are stated in the Professional Summary and reinforced by the AWS Solutions Architect internship (designing scalable AWS architectures, Glue/Athena pipelines). Python and AWS (Glue, Lambda, QuickSight) are explicit in Technical Expertise and projects. Snowflake and SQL are mentioned in the summary/tech list but lack concrete, project-level Snowflake or expert-SQL examples (partial). Data modeling is not demonstrated beyond a high-level claim (partial/absent). The mandatory domain (asset management/financial services) is asserted in the summary but has no supporting employer or project experience (partial/absent). Seniority/title fit as a Lead Data Engineer/Data Architect is not supported—experience is internships rather than senior/lead implementations (absent). Location matches NYC (explicit). Due to several partial/absent items (data modeling, expert SQL evidence, domain experience, seniority) and some generic/untailored claims, I deducted points from a perfect score, yielding a final alignment score of 5.
Impact: Three bullets are fully specified with clear metrics and outcomes (AWS sentiment pipeline: processed over 1M records and enabled 5× faster feedback-to-action; AWS model fine-tuning: +5% accuracy and −8% toxicity/hallucinations; IT Instructor: 96% cohort graduation). Several other bullets (AWS architecture/POC, WOPLLI project items, IT Support items, technical project bullets) lack quantifiable metrics or explicit business outcomes. Language is generally active, so only a small penalty for occasional vague phrasing. Given multiple strong metric-driven bullets but many missing elements across ~15 bullets, the output fits the mid-high band.

Excellent persona alignment: vocabulary and emphasis match cloud/ML/solutions-architect roles (Bedrock, SageMaker, Athena/Glue/Lambda, FastAPI, LLMs) and relevant certifications support the target role. Minor shortcoming: a few percentage gains lack clear baselines, which would strengthen impact claims. No notable score mismatches across criteria.
Alignment: Strong skills alignment: explicit mentions of Python (Core Skills), modern architectural patterns/microservices (Core Skills), scalable systems (Professional Summary; AWS internship ‘Designed secure, scalable AWS reference architectures’), performance optimization (Professional Summary; ‘automated sentiment-analysis pipeline processing 1M+ records…enhancing feedback loops by 5x’), and machine learning/LLMs (Core Skills; AWS internship fine-tuning in SageMaker, Bedrock POC). Partial match: vector databases are stated in the summary but lack specific tooling or project-level evidence. Major omissions: senior-level title/years and clear leadership/ownership examples (resume shows internships and early-career roles rather than a Sr. Software Engineer), and no explicit company-specific tailoring to Robert Half. Penalized for those gaps and some generic summary wording, resulting in a mid‑high alignment score.
Impact: Multiple strong, measurable bullets exist (AWS sentiment pipeline: 1M+ records and 5x feedback-loop improvement; SageMaker tuning: ~5% accuracy / ~8% toxicity reduction; IT Instructor: 36 lessons for 200+ learners with 96% graduation; Alfred project: 60% reduction in application time), which demonstrates clear accomplishments, metrics, and business impact. However, a large number of bullets lack quantification and explicit outcomes (e.g., “Designed secure, scalable AWS reference architectures,” “Configured Azure cloud environments,” “Managed API integration and testing scripts,” and several WOPLLI and IT Support lines); many of these miss the required metric and/or business outcome. I applied the evaluation steps: counted fully-specified bullets (4), subtracted for missing elements per bullet, and applied a small penalty for some vague/replaceable verbs (e.g., “managed,” “configured,” “supported”). The mix of solid, high-impact bullets and numerous unquantified/vague bullets merits a mid-range score reflecting good strengths but inconsistent quantification across the resume.

Certifications and project (Alfred — FastAPI + OpenAI GPT system) are also present. Minor omissions/conflicts: several lower-weight language claims in the Actual Output (JavaScript, HTML, C#, PHP) are not listed in the structured core_skills (Java and .NET appear only in artifact text), so those items are unsupported by the primary retrieval record.

Tone: High professionalism: clean layout, clear headings (Contact, Summary, Education, Skills, Experience, Projects, Certifications), correct grammar, and inclusion of LinkedIn and contact details; minor tense consistency issues are minimal. Strong action-orientation: many action verbs and quantified impacts (e.g., “1M+ records,” “5× faster feedback loops,” “improving accuracy by ~5%,” “reducing toxicity by ~8%,” “Reduced time to apply by 60%,” “boosted weekly applications by 300%”). Strong persona alignment: language and emphasis match a cloud/ML Solutions Architect role (AWS, SageMaker, Bedrock, Glue, QuickSight) and the summary explicitly targets Robert Half. No category is 2+ points lower than the others. Overall score reflects consistently high marks across Professionalism, Action-Oriented, and Persona Alignment.
Alignment: The resume explicitly matches many job requirements: Python and modern architectures are listed in Core Skills and Summary; AWS and SageMaker experience is shown (Solutions Architect Intern at AWS, POCs with Bedrock, Glue, Lambda); ML/LLM work is explicit (fine-tuning models, RAG, FastAPI+GPT system); scalable systems and performance optimization are evidenced (designed scalable AWS reference architectures; automated a sentiment pipeline processing 1M+ records and delivering 5× faster feedback). Shortcomings: a key requested technology—vector databases—is absent (no mention of FAISS/Pinecone/Milvus or explicit vector DB usage), and senior-level experience is limited (role history is internships and recent graduation, with no clear leadership/long-term Sr. Engineer responsibilities), which weakens fit for a Sr. Software Engineer role. The resume does use company-specific language (explicitly mentions interest in Robert Half), and contains strong quantified results, so penalties are moderate rather than severe.
Impact: Strong presence of action-oriented, measurable bullets — e.g., automated sentiment pipeline processing 1M+ records with 5× faster feedback loops, fine-tuned models (+~5% accuracy, −8% toxicity), 100+ support tickets, 36 lessons for 200+ learners with a 96% graduation rate, and project results (−60% time to apply, +300% weekly applications). These demonstrate clear accomplishments, numeric metrics, and business impact. Shortcomings: several bullets lack quantification or an explicit business outcome (e.g., “Designed and presented secure, scalable AWS reference architectures,” the WOPLLI bullets — Virtual Credential System, Azure configuration, API scripts — and the Alfred system development line), and a few lines use generic phrasing (e.g., “configured,” “developed”) that weakens impact. Overall balance of multiple strong, specific bullets but several under-specified ones warrants a high but not perfect score.

All listed employers and dates match the Retrieval Context (Solutions Architect Intern — AWS Jun 2025–Sep 2025; Software Developer Intern — WOPLLI Jun 2024–Sep 2024; IT Support Intern — Mayor’s Office Feb 2024–May 2024; IT Instructor Assistant — RF CUNY & Generation USA Feb 2022–Aug 2023). Core technologies and tools largely align: Python (pandas, scikit-learn, PyTorch), AWS services (EC2, S3, Lambda, RDS, DynamoDB, Glue, SageMaker, Bedrock references in experience), Azure App Service/Functions, ETL (Glue, SSIS), QuickSight/Power BI, FastAPI, Docker, Git, Postman, Swagger, and project details (FastAPI + OpenAI) are all supported by the Retrieval Context. Minor omissions/not exact matches (lower-weight): retrieval includes additional items not enumerated in the Actual Output such as Macie, seaborn, explicit R programming mention, and certain DB mentions (Postgre/pgvector are in project artifacts) — these are omissions but not fabrications or conflicts. No substantive conflicts or invented high-weight facts were found. Given full consistency on degrees, employers, dates and broad alignment on core technologies, score reflects strong verification.",325,2025-12-19 00:37:05.366474,8,10
236,1094,P3,10,9,7,42,"Punctuality: The score is 1.00 because the Contradictions list is empty, indicating no discrepancies between the actual output and the retrieval context — excellent alignment.
Tone: The resume is highly professional — clear header, polished summary, consistent formatting, and no notable grammar issues. It is strongly action-oriented: frequent action verbs and multiple quantified impacts (e.g., processing over 1M records, 5x feedback loop improvement, 5% accuracy gain, 8% toxicity reduction, 60% time reduction, 96% graduation rate). Persona alignment is good for software/cloud/AI roles and explicitly references Meta, but there is a modest mismatch in emphasis (heavy AWS/solutions-architect and certification focus versus the typical product/scale emphasis for Meta SDE roles) and minor chronology items that could be clarified. No individual category falls 2+ points below the others.
Alignment: The resume matches many technical requirements but lacks clear senior/product ownership and some product-facing responsibilities. Explicit matches: multiple required languages and tools (Core Skills lists Python, Java, JavaScript, C++, Swift, Kotlin), cloud/architecture experience (AWS Solutions Architect Intern: “Designed secure, scalable AWS architectures”), API and testing/CI/CD experience (FastAPI project, CI/CD pipelines), and performance optimization (“Automated sentiment-analysis pipelines…1M records”, “Fine-tuned ML models”). Partial matches: cross-functional leadership and setting technical direction are claimed in the Professional Summary (“leading cross-functional teams”) but the Experience entries are mainly internship roles without concrete examples of leading complex product efforts or establishing component ownership. Absent or weak: implementing custom user interfaces, explicit ownership of a component/feature/system, demonstrated track record of driving consensus at team level, and mention of code-review/process improvements and unit testing practices. Minimum-qualification ambiguity: the summary states “over 6 years” yet listed work history is internship-heavy, making the seniority claim partial. Given several strong explicit technical matches but multiple important partial/absent senior/product items, and a modest penalty for ambiguous seniority/ownership, the alignment score is seven out of ten.
Impact: Several bullets are strong and action-oriented: AWS intern bullets include concrete metrics (processed >1M records, 5x faster feedback loops; +5% accuracy; −8% toxicity), the Alfred project cites a 60% reduction in application time, and the instructor role shows 36 lessons for 200+ learners with a 96% graduation rate — each couples a clear accomplishment, metric, and outcome. Shortcomings: multiple bullets lack measurable results or explicit business impact (WOPLLI developer bullets, the IT Support automation says “significantly reducing manual workload” without a metric, and some lines use vague/boilerplate phrasing like “ensuring compliance” or “enhancing performance”), which per the rubric requires point deductions and a penalty for passive/weak language. Given multiple fully-specified bullets but several partial/vague ones, the resume aligns well but is not uniformly quantified or impact-focused.
CredTail: Verified: name, email, phone, LinkedIn/GitHub links, location; both degrees (MSc expected Jan 2026, BTech Jun 2024) with GPAs and honors; employers and employment dates for AWS (Jun 2025–Sep 2025), WOPLLI (Jun 2024–Sep 2024), Mayor’s Office (Feb 2024–May 2024), and RF CUNY & Generation USA (Feb 2022–Aug 2023) match the Retrieval Context; core technologies including Python, Java, SQL/NoSQL, AWS (EC2,S3,Lambda,SageMaker,Bedrock,Glue), Azure (App Service, Functions), FastAPI, Docker, CI/CD, PostgreSQL/MongoDB, SIEM/IDS/Active Directory, and the Alfred project details are corroborated; certifications listed are present. Missing/conflicting: the resume claim of “over 6 years of experience” conflicts with the timeline in the Retrieval Context (internships from 2022–2025) and appears fabricated; several programming languages in Core Skills (C++, Swift, Kotlin) are not found in the Retrieval Context (omissions). Deductions reflect that high-weight items (degrees, employers, dates, major cloud/AI technologies) are consistent, but the explicit multi-year experience claim and unsupported language entries reduce credibility.",330,2025-12-19 00:41:17.717762,8,8
237,1068,P3,10,9,6,42,"Punctuality: The score is 1.00 because the contradictions list is empty, indicating the actual output aligns fully with the retrieval context—great job!
Tone: Professionalism (4/5): document is well-formatted, formal, and grammatically strong with clear sections and working links; minor polish issues include a future expected degree date and occasional tense/consistency polish needed. Action-Oriented (5/5): bullets use strong action verbs and include measurable impact (e.g., “processing 1M+ records,” “5× faster feedback loops,” “~5% accuracy improvement,” “~8% toxicity reduction,” “60% time savings”), which shows clear outcome focus. Persona Alignment (4/5): tone, vocabulary, and emphasis align well with cloud/AI/systems roles and the stated Meta target, though a few bullets could better tie technical work to product/metric outcomes for a specific role. Calculated average shows consistently high scores and no single category is 2+ points below the others, so no notable mismatch.
Alignment: Strengths: The resume explicitly matches many core technical requirements — Professional Summary and Core Skills call out systems-level and distributed systems, Programming Languages lists Python/Java/C++/JavaScript, SQL and relational DBs (PostgreSQL/MySQL/etc.), Version Control (Git), Linux/UNIX, and web tech (HTML/CSS/REST/FastAPI). Experience at AWS notes scalable reference architectures and a 1M+ record pipeline (Experience → Solutions Architect Intern), and the Bachelor’s degree is present (Education → Bachelor of Technology). Shortcomings: Key Meta responsibilities are absent or only partially addressed — no explicit OS-level software, compiler, or network-distribution development experience (no resume section shows kernel/OS/compilers), limited evidence of producing high-quality code with documented test coverage or unit/integration testing, and missing tools like VIM/Emacs or Subversion/Perforce (Core Skills shows Git only). Production-grade high-volume server development and long-term distributed-systems ownership are only implied via internships/POCs rather than explicit large-scale product delivery. The resume is mildly tailored to Meta (summary mentions Meta) but contains some generic phrasing and lacks explicit evidence for several major responsibilities. These factors lead to a moderate deduction from a perfect fit.
Impact: The resume contains multiple strong, measurable bullets (e.g., automated pipeline processing 1M+ records with 5× faster feedback loops; SageMaker tuning improving accuracy ~5% and reducing toxicity ~8%; 96% cohort graduation rate; 36 lessons for 200+ learners; Alfred reducing time-to-apply by 60%), demonstrating clear business impact. However several bullets (many WOPLLI items, some IT Support and one AWS POC/architecture line) lack quantifiable metrics and explicit outcomes, weakening overall consistency. A small penalty is also applied for a few vague/replaceable phrases (e.g., “produced,” “configured and tested,” “built POCs”) that reduce clarity. Scoring balances multiple high-quality, numeric-impact bullets against several unmeasured/ambiguous ones.
CredTail: Verified: both degrees (M.S. Data Science & ML — Expected Jan 2026; B.Tech CIS — Jun 2024) match the Retrieval Context (GPA/honors match). All four employers and employment dates match exactly (AWS: Jun 2025–Sep 2025; WOPLLI: Jun 2024–Sep 2024; Mayor’s Office: Feb 2024–May 2024; RF CUNY & Generation USA: Feb 2022–Aug 2023). Major core technologies and project details are consistent (Python with pandas/scikit‑learn/PyTorch, SQL/NoSQL, AWS services including Bedrock/SageMaker/Glue/QuickSight in experience, Azure App Service/Functions, FastAPI, PostgreSQL, OpenAI/GPT family, Docker, QuickSight/Power BI, SIEM/IDS/Active Directory). Missing/conflicting items (reasons for deductions): C++ appears in the Actual Output but is not present in the Retrieval Context (fabrication/omission of evidence); Operating Systems list in Actual includes UNIX and Windows which are not present in the Retrieval Context (only Linux is explicitly listed); minor tech-name variance in the project (Actual says “GPT‑4 Mini” vs Retrieval’s “GPT‑4.1 mini”) and slight differences in which AWS services are enumerated in the Core Skills list (Actual’s AWS list omits some AWS items present in Retrieval, though those services are mentioned elsewhere). Because high‑weight items (degrees, employers, dates, major cloud/AI skills) are fully consistent and only a few lower‑weight technology mentions are unsupported or slightly inconsistent, I assign a high score.",335,2025-12-19 00:46:05.457068,8,9

Tone: Professionalism: strong formatting, clear sections, correct grammar, and polished contact/header (scored high). Action-Oriented: many action verbs and quantified impacts (1M+ records automated, 5× faster feedback loops, ~5% accuracy gain, ~8% toxicity reduction, 60% time savings, 300% application increase), showing measurable results. Persona Alignment: content and tone match a Data Engineer role (Python, ETL/ELT, AWS services, QuickSight, data pipelines, data warehousing) and emphasizes relevant projects and internships. All three subscores are consistently high with no score differing by 2+ points, yielding a top alignment overall.
Alignment: Extracted requirements: scalable data systems/pipelines; data modeling; ETL workflows/tools; optimizing data storage/data warehousing; cross-functional collaboration; mandatory experience with global financial instruments; strong Python. Assessment of resume: scalable systems/pipelines — explicit (Professional Summary + AWS internship: automated pipeline processing 1M+ records). ETL/tools — explicit (Glue/Athena/Lambda called out in AWS experience; ETL listed in Core Skills). Python — explicit (Core Skills and multiple Python scripting examples). Data modeling — partial (listed in Core Skills and summary but no concrete schema design or modeling deliverables). Data warehousing/optimization — partial (mentions QuickSight/analytics and “data warehousing initiatives” in summary but no specific warehouse tech/configuration or optimization examples like Redshift/Snowflake or schema performance tuning). Financial instruments (equities, fixed income, options, exotics) — partial/weak (summary asserts domain experience, but no role, project, or quantified example evidencing work with those asset classes). Cross-functional collaboration — explicit/partial (vendor management and collaborative language present). Tailoring — present (summary references DL Software Inc.), but some wording remains generic. Given several strong explicit matches (ETL, pipelines, Python, AWS tooling) offset by important partial/absent items (finance domain evidence, concrete data modeling and data-warehousing deliverables) and minor penalty for generic phrasing, the alignment is moderate-to-strong.
Impact: Multiple bullets include clear metrics and business impact (e.g., automated pipeline processing 1M+ records with 5× faster feedback loops; SageMaker fine-tuning +~5% accuracy / −8% toxicity; Alfred project reducing apply time by 60% and increasing weekly apps by 300%; 96% cohort graduation rate; refurbished/tracked 800+ devices). I count about five fully-specified bullets. However many bullets (several in WOPLLI, AWS, and IT Support) state accomplishments without quantifiable metrics or explicit business outcomes (e.g., “Designed…”, “Configured…”, “Developed…”, “Managed…”), which reduces clarity and measurable impact. Language is occasionally vague/replaceable, meriting a small penalty. Balancing the strong, measurable bullets against multiple vague ones and mild passive phrasing yields a score reflecting solid strengths but room for better quantification and outcome framing.

No conflicting details or fabrications found. Minor omissions: certifications listed in the Retrieval Context (AWS certs, Google certificates) and the MS GPA/honors detail (4.0, Dean’s List 2x) are not reproduced in the Actual Output; these are low-weight omissions and do not contradict high-weight items.

Tone: Professionalism: high marks for polished formatting, clear sections, correct grammar, and professional summary. Action-Oriented: strong use of action verbs and quantified impact (e.g., “1M+ records,” “5× faster feedback loops,” “~5% accuracy improvement,” “Reduced time to apply by 60%,” “300% boost,” “96% cohort graduation rate”). Persona Alignment: closely matches a cloud/solutions-architect/AI persona with AWS, SageMaker, Bedrock, EC2/S3/Lambda details and architecture-focused responsibilities. All three sub-scores are consistent (no single score is 2+ points lower than the others), so no notable mismatch.
Alignment: Strengths: the resume explicitly lists required technologies from the JD—Java, GoLang, C#, JavaScript/HTML/CSS and Figma (Core Skills), cloud platforms AWS and Azure (Core Skills + AWS internship), and databases including Oracle and DynamoDB (Core Skills). The AWS internship shows cloud-scale work (POC, pipeline processing 1M+ records and 5× faster dashboards) supporting some expected outcomes. Shortcomings: major JD anchors are missing or only partial—the role asks for 10+ years and Principal-level technical leadership and long-term experience operating mission-critical, large-scale distributed services, but the resume’s timeline (BS graduated Jun 2024, internships in 2024–2025) and listed positions are junior/intern roles, so the claimed “over 10 years” in the summary is inconsistent and unsubstantiated by the Experience section. Deep expertise areas called for in the JD—networking protocols (TCP/IP, HTTP), distributed persistence/storage architecture, sustained troubleshooting/performance tuning, and explicit operational/live-site ownership—are not evidenced or are only implicitly hinted (few quantified tuning outcomes). Also the resume is not tailored to Oracle or a Principal/IC4 level (no mention of Oracle, Principal, or equivalent senior-level responsibilities). Given several critical absences and only partial matches to key responsibilities, the alignment is low.
Impact: Multiple bullets are action-oriented and include specific numeric metrics with clear business impact (e.g., automated sentiment pipeline processing 1M+ records and 5× faster feedback loops; SageMaker tuning improved accuracy ~5% and reduced toxicity ~8%; 96% cohort graduation rate; Alfred project reduced apply time by 60% and increased weekly applications by 300%). These meet the high-band criteria. Shortcomings: several bullets (e.g., “Designed and presented secure, scalable AWS reference architectures,” WOPLLI responsibilities) lack quantification or explicit business outcomes, and a few lines are somewhat generic. Minor passive/boilerplate phrasing is present but not pervasive, so a small deduction was applied.
CredTail: Verified high-weight items: both degrees (M.S. Data Science & ML - Expected Jan 2026; B.Tech CIS - Jun 2024) and all four employers with matching titles and dates (AWS Solutions Architect Intern Jun 2025–Sep 2025; WOPLLI Jun 2024–Sep 2024; Mayor’s Office Feb 2024–May 2024; RF CUNY/Generation Feb 2022–Aug 2023) are present and consistent with the Retrieval Context. Contact info (email, phone, LinkedIn, GitHub), certifications, and major project highlights (Alfred — FastAPI + OpenAI + RAG) are also supported. Missing/conflicting items: the Actual Output adds several programming languages and tools (Java, GoLang, C#, JavaScript, HTML/CSS, Figma) that do not appear in the Retrieval Context (treated as unverified/fabricated). The Actual Output also omits or generalizes AWS services that are listed in the Retrieval Context (Glue, QuickSight, Bedrock, SageMaker, Macie) and omits some project tech details (pgvector, google-genai, explicit GPT-4.1 mini naming). A physical address in the resume is not present in the Retrieval Context. Because degrees and employers (high-weight items) fully match but multiple unverified technology claims and several omissions exist, I applied moderate deductions per the evaluation rules.",345,2025-12-19 00:53:49.516106,9,7

Tone: Professionalism scored high for clear formatting, correct grammar, polished sections, and complete contact/education entries, but has minor inconsistencies (claims “Senior Data Analyst with over 5 years” vs. internship-heavy experience and an unexplained “UniUni Logistics” reference). Action‑Oriented strength: uses action verbs and provides concrete metrics (65,000+ records, 5x improvement for sentiment pipeline, 96% graduation rate), but several bullets lack quantified impact and could be more result-focused. Persona Alignment is moderate: vocabulary, tools (SQL, Python, Power BI, Tableau, AWS) and project examples fit a data role, yet the senior-level claim and timeline/experience mismatch weaken credibility for a Senior Data Analyst persona. Average of the three ratings maps to a mid‑high overall score; no single category is 2+ points below the others, so no notable mismatch flagged.
Alignment: The resume has several explicit matches: the Professional Summary and Technical Skills explicitly list SQL, Python, R, and BI tools (Power BI, QuickSight, Tableau), and Projects/Experience show database design and SQL usage (Financial Stocks Report; EZRental database). However, key requirements are partially or fully absent: the candidate’s education is CUNY (not the 985/211 requirement) and listed roles are largely internships rather than 5+ years of proven senior business-analysis delivery; there is no clear evidence of multiple mature project launches or 0→1 project ownership, no explicit examples of exploratory anomaly attribution or long-term trend interpretation for business outcomes, no documented cross-departmental implementations that drove measurable logistics business actions, and no mention of independent multi-channel data sourcing or high-level executive insight decks/PPTs. Language is somewhat generic despite one-line tailoring to UniUni Logistics. These partials and absences justify a mid-level alignment score.
Impact: The resume contains 8 action bullets in Projects/Experience. Four bullets include clear numeric metrics and outcomes (65,000+ records; 5x faster feedback loops; support for 400+ devices; 36 lessons/200 learners with a 96% graduation rate), demonstrating measurable impact. The remaining four bullets (EZRental DB design; AWS architecture; automated troubleshooting workflows; test-materials/engagement tracking) lack quantification and/or explicit business outcomes, which per the guidance warrants deductions (example −2 per missing metric/outcome). Additionally, several bullets use vague enhancement wording (e.g., “enhancing,” “significantly reducing”) that weakens impact and triggers a modest passive/weak-language penalty. Balancing the multiple strong, fully-specified bullets against the partially-specified ones yields a mid-high score reflecting notable strengths but incomplete consistency in measurable outcomes.

Minor additions in Actual (Tableau, Excel) are not present in the core_skills list (unverified).

Action-Oriented: strong use of action verbs and quantified impact throughout (e.g., automated pipeline processing 1M+ records, 5× faster feedback loops, ~5% model accuracy gain, 96% cohort graduation, 60% time reduction, 300% application increase). Persona Alignment: language, skills, and tools align with data/ETL/BI roles, but there is a minor mismatch in seniority—labeling as a “Senior” ETL & Data Analyst contrasts with mostly internship experience—and one line tailored specifically to Touro University which could narrow general applicability. Category scores were close (no score was 2+ points below the others), so the overall assessment reflects strong alignment with only a small persona/seniority concern.
Alignment: Explicit matches: SSIS, Power BI, and SSRS appear in both the PROFESSIONAL SUMMARY and CORE SKILLS; SQL query/stored-procedure work is claimed in summary and SQL/SQL Server is listed under Core Skills; REST/SOAP, JSON, XML, C#, .NET, and Visual Studio are explicitly listed. Partial matches: Robotic Process Automation is present only as a generic skill (no tooling/workato/okta examples); ETL/design details are high-level (mentions SSIS/SSIS use) but no explicit SSIS package examples for complex ETL/data migrations or SFTP file-transfer management. Absent or weak items: SSAS, IIS Server, SFTP transfers, Okta API, Workato, documented change-management/code-review/testing protocols, and participation in departmental/committee meetings are not shown. Requirements gap: the job asks for a master’s in MIS/CS (plus 3 years experience) — the resume shows a Master’s in progress (expected 2026) and mostly internship roles (no 3+ years senior IT development experience). Given multiple explicit matches but several important absences and the senior/degree experience gap (plus some generic wording), the alignment is moderate.
Impact: The resume includes multiple strong, action-oriented bullets with clear metrics and business impact (e.g., AWS: automated pipeline processing 1M+ records with 5× faster feedback loops; SageMaker fine-tuning +5% accuracy / −8% toxicity; Alfred project: −60% time to apply and +300% weekly applications; IT Instructor: 36 lessons for 200+ learners and 96% graduation; 100+ ‘white glove’ tickets). However, several bullets lack quantifiable metrics and explicit business outcomes (AWS “Designed and presented” lacks metrics/outcome; most WOPLLI bullets and some Mayor’s Office items have no numbers or clear business impact). There is also some vague/passive language (e.g., “managed,” “supported”) that warrants a small penalty. Following the evaluation steps (count of metric-driven bullets, per-bullet checks for accomplishment/metric/outcome, and passive-language penalties), the content merits a score in the upper mid band.

Tone: Professionalism is strong — the document is well-formatted, formal in tone, and grammatically clean with clear sections and contact info. Action-oriented elements are good — uses action verbs and includes quantified achievements (e.g., 36 lessons, 200+ learners, 96% graduation rate), though some volunteer bullets lack explicit outcome/impact phrasing. Persona alignment is weak for the stated nursing target: the summary’s patient-centered language is undermined by predominantly tech-focused education, IT experience, and no clinical qualifications, creating a notable mismatch that meets the flagged threshold. Overall: polished and impact-oriented for IT/education roles but insufficiently aligned to a nursing role.
Alignment: Job requires a Registered Nurse for Encompass Health Rehabilitation Hospital of Treasure Coast (full-time 7P-7A, clinical inpatient/rehab care). Expected items: RN license/credentials, clinical skills (medication administration, vital signs, wound care, rehab therapies), BLS/ACLS, inpatient/rehab experience, shift availability, and interdisciplinary patient-care outcomes. The Actual Output is technology-focused (MS Data Science in progress, IT Instructor Assistant, IT Support intern, AWS/Google certs) with no RN license, no clinical experience or nursing certifications, and no mention of medication administration, wound care, BLS/ACLS, or shift availability — these are absent. Partial matches: patient-centered language in the summary, bilingual Spanish, and teamwork/communication skills are present but not clinical. The resume only lightly references Encompass Health in a generic sentence and lacks tailoring to the specific rehab RN role. Given mostly absent critical nursing qualifications and additional penalty for generic/company-light tailoring, the alignment is very low.
Impact: Two strong bullets include measurable metrics (36 lessons to 200+ learners; 96% cohort graduation rate), but only the graduation-rate bullet clearly contains all three required elements (accomplishment, metric, explicit business outcome). Four other bullets lack quantifiable metrics and explicit business outcomes (e.g., “developed testing materials”; “provide white glove service”; “collaborate…restore and maintain”; “utilize various tools”), and several use vague/replaceable phrasing that triggers the passive/vague penalty. Following the evaluation steps (count of fully-specified bullets = 1, multiple missing metric/outcome elements across bullets with proportional penalties, plus language penalties), the overall alignment is moderate but limited by the numerous unspecified results and weak wording.

Missing/conflicting: Mayor’s Office role appears in Retrieval as “IT Support Intern” dated Feb 2024–May 2024 but Actual Output lists “Volunteer IT Support and Development Intern” Feb 2024–Current (date/status and title conflict) — treated as a factual conflict; two high-weight employers in the Retrieval (AWS Solutions Architect Intern Jun–Sep 2025 and Software Developer Intern at WOPLLI Jun–Sep 2024) are omitted in the Actual Output (significant omission). Major omissions: the Retrieval’s comprehensive technical core-skills (Python, AWS services, SQL/NoSQL, ML/ETL/LLM tooling, etc.) are largely absent from the Actual Output’s short, non-technical Core Skills. Summary mismatch: Retrieval describes a technologist/AI focus while Actual’s summary targets a nursing role (inconsistent with evidence). Given full agreement on degrees and some roles but conflicts on employment dates/status, omission of a major AWS internship, and absence of core technologies, I apply substantial deductions and assign a below-midline credibility score.",359,2025-12-19 01:04:02.917606,6,4

Tone: Scores derived from the three evaluation steps indicate very strong alignment. Professionalism: polished, well-structured resume with clear headings, correct grammar, and consistent formatting (clean contact block, education, skills, experience). Action-Oriented: bullets use active verbs and measurable achievements throughout (e.g., “processed 1M+ records,” “5× faster feedback loops,” “improved accuracy ~5%,” “reduced toxicity ~8%,” “96% cohort graduation rate,” “100+ tickets”), demonstrating clear accomplishment focus. Persona Alignment: tone, vocabulary, and emphasis closely match a solutions-focused technologist/solutions architect working with AWS, LLMs, data pipelines, and CI/CD (mentions Bedrock, Athena/Glue/Lambda, SageMaker, FastAPI, GitHub Actions). Minor weaknesses: occasional tense inconsistency across bullets and some reliance on acronyms that could be expanded for broader audiences. Overall, each category earned top marks, yielding the maximum possible average and indicating strengths in action-oriented impact and professional presentation with only small polish opportunities.
Alignment: Checklist extracted: must-haves — Linux-based system development (SME), embedded engineering, C++, .NET; nice-to-have — cloud/CI/CD, AWS, quantified outcomes. Resume matches C++ and .NET explicitly (Core Skills). Linux is a partial match (listed under Core Skills and Linux taught in instructor role) but lacks explicit Linux-based systems development or SME-level system engineering. Embedded engineering is missing entirely. Resume has strong, quantified cloud/AI outcomes (1M+ records pipeline, 5× faster feedback loops, model improvements ~5%/~8%, 96% graduation rate) and clear tool usage (AWS, Docker, CI/CD), which are positives but not role-aligned to embedded/Linux systems. Penalized for mismatch with senior/SME expectation (mostly internship roles) and absence of embedded systems experience. Overall coverage of required items is partial (~60–75%), with quality of outcomes high but not in the target domain, so score adjusted downward for critical missing expertise and seniority mismatch.
Impact: Strong use of action verbs and multiple clear metrics in key bullets (e.g., automated sentiment pipeline processing 1M+ records with 5× faster feedback loops; SageMaker tuning improving accuracy ~5% and reducing toxicity ~8%; delivered 36 lessons to 200+ learners with a 96% graduation rate; 100+ VIP tickets handled). These meet Steps 1–2 well. Deductions applied for several vague/passive bullets lacking measurable outcomes (e.g., ‘Designed and presented secure, scalable AWS reference architectures’ and WOPLLI bullets with no quantifiable impact, and project descriptions without metrics), which reduces clarity of business impact per Step 3. Overall, the resume contains several strong, measurable accomplishments but also multiple non‑metric statements, so the score reflects solid but not perfect adherence to the evaluation criteria.
CredTail: Followed Retrieval Context closely: degrees (MS Data Science expected Jan 2026; B.Tech Jun 2024) and honors are present; employers and dates for Solutions Architect Intern (AWS Jun 2025–Sep 2025), Software Developer Intern (WOPLLI Jun 2024–Sep 2024), IT Support Intern (Mayor’s Office Feb 2024–May 2024), and IT Instructor Assistant (RF CUNY & Generation USA Feb 2022–Aug 2023) all match; project (Alfred) and certifications match; many core technologies in experience (Bedrock, Athena/Glue/Lambda, QuickSight, SageMaker, PostgreSQL, FastAPI, Docker, OpenAI GPT-4.1 mini) are reflected. Shortcomings: no fabricated claims detected, but the Actual Output omits the GitHub link from the Retrieval Context and leaves out several core AWS services/technologies listed in the Context (Glue, QuickSight, Bedrock, SageMaker, Macie) from the Core Skills section even though some appear in experience; it also omits certain experience highlights (e.g., refurbished/tracked ~800 devices and ServiceNow asset inventory) found in the Context. Score reflects accurate matching of critical items (degrees, employers, dates) with small deductions for omitted technologies and experience details.",308,2025-12-19 00:23:33.799179,8,7
243,470,P1,10,10,3,41,"Punctuality: The score is 1.00 because the Contradictions list is empty, indicating there are no discrepancies and the actual output fully aligns with the retrieval context.
Tone: All three evaluated dimensions score very strong. Professionalism: clean, well-organized formatting, clear headers, and polished tone throughout. Action-oriented: frequent strong verbs and quantified results (e.g., “processing over 1M feedback records,” “5× faster feedback-to-action,” “5% increase,” “8% reduction,” “96% cohort graduation rate”) that emphasize impact. Persona alignment: content closely matches a Solutions Architect / Generative AI/data-focused persona (extensive AWS stack, Bedrock, SageMaker, RAG, FastAPI, CI/CD). No notable gaps among the component scores (no ≥1-point discrepancy); only minor nitpicks are possible (very small chronological/contextual details), but they do not materially affect the assessment.
Alignment: Matches: resume shows strong AWS experience (Glue, Lambda, SageMaker, QuickSight), expert SQL/Python, ETL/ELT and data modeling, plus measurable pipeline outcomes (1M records processed, 5× faster turnaround, accuracy/toxicity improvements). Missing: no Snowflake mention and the mandatory domain experience (asset management, alternatives investments, financial services) is absent. Specificity/relevance: resume uses cloud/data-architecture language but does not reference the Data Engineer title, Cloud BC Labs, or senior/lead data engineering responsibilities—roles are intern/early-career and off-target for a Lead Data Engineer/Architect hire. Outcomes/metrics: there are quantifiable results, but they are not tied to the required financial domain or enterprise asset-management outcomes. Overall assessment: meaningful technical overlaps (AWS Glue, SQL, Python, data modeling, ETL) are outweighed by missing mandatory domain expertise, Snowflake, and seniority/role-specific alignment, so the resume only partially fits the job requirements.
Impact: Strong use of action verbs and multiple specific, measurable outcomes (e.g., “processed over 1M feedback records,” “5× faster feedback-to-action,” “5% increase in output accuracy” and “8% reduction in toxicity,” plus “36 lessons for 200+ learners” and “96% cohort graduation rate”), which fits the top tier of the rubric. However several bullets are vague or lack metrics (e.g., “Designed and presented secure, scalable AWS architectures,” WOPLLI items, and some automation/support lines), which warrants a small deduction for missing quantification and occasional non-actionable phrasing. Overall the resume presents multiple clear metrics and business outcomes but is not uniformly metric-rich across every bullet.
CredTail: High fidelity: core personal info (name, location, email, phone, LinkedIn/GitHub) and summary match the Retrieval Context verbatim. Education entries are verified (CUNY SPS MS Data Science & ML, GPA 4.0, Expected Jan 2026; CUNY NYC College of Technology B.Tech CIS, GPA 3.78, Jun 2024, Dean’s List, National Honor Society). All four work experiences and their dates (Solutions Architect Intern at AWS Jun 2025–Sep 2025; Software Developer Intern WOPLLI Jun 2024–Sep 2024; IT Support Intern Feb 2024–May 2024; IT Instructor Assistant Feb 2022–Aug 2023) and major technical highlights (Bedrock, Athena, Glue, Lambda, QuickSight, SageMaker, 1M+ record pipeline, fine-tuning improvements) appear verbatim in the Retrieval Context. Project “Alfred” and listed technologies (FastAPI, PostgreSQL + pgvector, OpenAI GPT-4.1 mini, Docker, CI/CD, RAG) also match. Technical expertise (AWS services, Python libraries, QuickSight, Power BI, Docker, Git) is consistent. Penalized items: one certification from the Retrieval Context (Google Information Support Certificate) is omitted in the Actual Output, and a few experience highlights (e.g., CrowdStrike monitoring, device refurbishment, some WOPLLI bullet points) are not included. These omissions reduce completeness but do not indicate fabrication, so the output is scored highly with moderate deductions for missing items.",313,2025-12-19 05:33:01.400123,9,9
244,3,P1,9.736842105263158,10,4,41.73684210526316,"Punctuality: The score is 0.97 because the only noted contradiction is a single phone-number inconsistency: the structured profile lists 347-491-2955 while the Artifacts section lists 929-305-7353, so the actual output used one of these conflicting numbers, causing a minor faithfulness error.
Tone: High professionalism: clean, consistent formatting and formal language throughout the resume (clear headings, contact block, no major grammar issues). Strong action-orientation: uses active verbs and quantified outcomes (e.g., “automated a sentiment-analysis pipeline processing 1M+ records,” “5× faster feedback loops,” “improving accuracy by ~5%,” “reduced time to apply by 60%”). Strong persona alignment: content and keywords map closely to solutions-architect/data-engineering/ML roles (AWS services, SageMaker, Bedrock, Glue, QuickSight, ETL, data warehousing, relevant certifications). Minor shortcomings are limited — a bit of dense jargon (“agentic AI tooling”) and a future-dated internship relative to the expected degree timeline that could be clarified — but these do not materially detract. All three categories are equally strong, so there is no clear weakest area.
Alignment: Step 1 (extraction): JD requires designing/building/maintaining scalable data systems and pipelines; data modeling; developing/managing ETL workflows; optimizing data storage/data warehousing; cross-functional collaboration; mandatory domain expertise in global financial instruments (equities, fixed income, options, exotic); strong Python; ETL tools; data warehousing experience. Step 2 (comparison): Resume provides explicit evidence for Python (“Proficient in Python”), ETL and ETL tools (“ETL/ELT (Glue, SSIS)”), AWS analytics stack (“Built POCs … with Athena/Glue/Lambda”, “QuickSight dashboards”), data modeling and warehousing (“experienced in data modeling and ETL processes”, “foundation in data warehousing initiatives”), and measurable outcomes (“Automated a sentiment-analysis pipeline processing 1M+ records”, “5× faster feedback loops”). It shows partial evidence for scalable pipelines and cross-functional work (AWS architecture design, vendor management, collaboration implied) but lacks specifics about large-scale production ops or performance/ storage optimization. Step 3 (templating/penalty): Resume is not tailored to the DL Software Inc. Data Engineer role—no mention of the job title or company, and critically there is no evidence of the mandatory global financial instruments experience (no mention of equities, fixed income, options, or exotica). That omission is a major disqualifier given the JD explicitly lists it as mandatory. Overall: good alignment on tools (AWS Glue, Athena, Lambda, QuickSight, SSIS), Python, ETL and some measurable results, but missing the required finance domain expertise and company/title tailoring, so alignment is moderate-to-weak.
Impact: The resume uses active, action-oriented language throughout (e.g., Designed, Built, Automated, Fine-tuned, Implemented, Delivered), and several bullets include strong measurable results: automated a sentiment pipeline processing 1M+ records with 5× faster feedback loops; fine-tuned SageMaker models improving accuracy ~5% and reducing toxicity ~8%; Alfred reduced time-to-apply by 60%; delivered 36 lessons to 200+ learners and maintained a 96% cohort graduation rate. These items clearly tie actions to business or program outcomes. Deductions stem from multiple vague bullets lacking metrics or impact (e.g., “Designed and presented secure, scalable AWS reference architectures,” “Built POCs…to deliver actionable sentiment insights,” “Managed relations with 3rd‑party vendors,” and generic API/testing bullets), which reduce overall clarity and comparability. On balance, strong measurable accomplishments and active phrasing dominate but incomplete quantification across several entries warrants a high-but-not-perfect score.
CredTail: High fidelity to the Retrieval Context: personal info (name, email, phone, LinkedIn, GitHub), summary, education entries (MS expected Jan 2026; B.Tech CIS, Jun 2024, GPA 3.78, Dean’s List 5x, National Honor Society), experience entries and dates (Solutions Architect Intern at AWS Jun 2025–Sep 2025; Software Developer Intern WOPLLI Jun 2024–Sep 2024; IT Support Feb 2024–May 2024; IT Instructor Assistant Feb 2022–Aug 2023) and core technologies (Python libs, AWS services including Glue/QuickSight/SageMaker, Azure, ETL tools, FastAPI/OpenAI project) are all present and consistent with the Retrieval Context. Minor omissions/approximate phrasings: Master’s honors/GPA (4.0, Dean’s List 2x) are shown in the Retrieval Context but not listed in the Actual Output; project techs in the Retrieval Context (PostgreSQL+pgvector, Google Generative AI, exact “GPT-4.1 mini” naming) are more specific than the Actual Output’s shorter labels (e.g., “GPT-4 Mini”), which reduces precision slightly but does not indicate fabrication. No fabricated claims detected. Apply only a small penalty for these minor specificity gaps.",338,2025-12-19 05:34:54.469787,8,10
245,1196,P1,10,10,7,46,"Punctuality: The score is 1.00 because the Contradictions list is empty, indicating no discrepancies were found and the actual output fully aligns with the retrieval context — nice work!
Tone: High professionalism: clear headings, consistent formatting, polished tone, and concise bullets across contact, summary, skills, experience, projects, and education. Strong action-orientation: frequent action verbs (Designed, Built, Automated, Fine-tuned, Developed) and multiple quantified results (processing 1M+ records, 5× faster feedback loops, ~5% accuracy gain and ~8% toxicity reduction, 96% cohort graduation, 100+ tickets). Strong persona alignment with Solutions Architect/ML roles through AWS Bedrock/SageMaker, data pipelines, LLMs, and FastAPI project work. All three sub-scores were top-rated with no >=1-point gaps, indicating consistent strengths rather than notable weaknesses.
Alignment: The resume aligns well with many job requirements: it explicitly lists Python, modern architectures (microservices, FastAPI, CI/CD), cloud/AWS experience (Bedrock, SageMaker, Glue, Lambda), machine learning work, and a vector DB implementation (PostgreSQL + pgvector in the Alfred project). It also includes measurable outcomes tied to relevant work (automated pipeline processing 1M+ records, 5× faster feedback loops, ~5% accuracy gain and ~8% toxicity reduction). Key gaps: the document is not tailored to Robert Half or the Sr. Software Engineer title (roles are internships/solutions architect intern), lacks clear long-term senior-level experience, and has limited explicit evidence of production-grade, large-scale system ownership or explicit performance-optimization projects. Overall strong technical/tool matches and metrics but short on seniority and role-specific targeting.
Impact: Strong presence of action verbs and multiple clear, quantifiable results (e.g., automated sentiment pipeline processing 1M+ records with 5× faster feedback loops; SageMaker fine-tuning improving accuracy ~5% and reducing toxicity ~8%; 36 lessons for 200+ learners and a 96% graduation rate; >100 support tickets handled). These tie to time-savings and quality improvements, meeting the high-tier criteria. Deductions for several bullets that remain vague or unquantified (e.g., “Designed and presented secure, scalable AWS reference architectures,” “Built POCs… to deliver actionable sentiment insights,” and “Automated troubleshooting workflows… to reduce manual workload” lack specific impact metrics), preventing a perfect score.

Tone: All three criteria were rated at the highest level because the resume is polished and well-structured (complete contact block, clear headings), uses action-oriented language with quantified outcomes (e.g., automated sentiment pipeline processing 1M+ records, 5× faster feedback loops, 60% reduction in application time, fine-tuned models with measured accuracy/toxicity improvements), and the content strongly aligns with the stated solutions-focused technologist persona (extensive AWS/ML/Generative AI skills, relevant internships, projects like an agentic job-search assistant). There is no significant imbalance among criteria (no difference ≥2 points) and Action-Oriented and Persona Alignment clearly support Professionalism. Minor nit: small wording/term inconsistencies (e.g., “Postgre”) but these do not materially reduce effectiveness.
Alignment: Following the evaluation steps: Responsibilities (50%) — mostly absent/partial. The resume shows architecture design, presentations, vendor relations and cross-team collaboration (partial matches) but lacks principal-level leadership evidence: no multi-year roadmap ownership, no large cross-functional/industry-wide engineering leadership, no executive mentoring, and no long-term technical vision for cross-company efforts (absent). Tools/Technologies (30%) — partial/strong match. Named infra/tools are well represented (Python, extensive AWS services including SageMaker/Bedrock/Glue/Athena, Docker, Postgres, Git, FastAPI) but key preferred items for the role (C/C++/Java and explicit JavaScript/Hack experience) are missing or not shown. Outcomes/Metrics (20%) — partial match. The resume contains concrete metrics (1M+ records processed, 5× faster feedback loops, model +5% accuracy/-8% toxicity, 60% time reduction, 300% increase in applications, 96% cohort grad rate) but these are project/intern-scale results rather than evidence of leading large-scale, multi-year infrastructure impact. Specificity adjustment: resume appears generic and not tailored to Meta/principal role (penalty applied). Concrete-evidence bonus: awarded small positive credit for multiple named tools and quantified results. Overall alignment is limited to strong technical tooling and measurable project outcomes but lacks the senior leadership, scale, multi-year roadmap and language breadth required for a Meta Principal Infrastructure Engineer.
Impact: The output repeatedly pairs clear action verbs with specific, measurable results indicating business impact — e.g., automated a sentiment pipeline processing 1M+ records with 5× faster feedback loops, fine-tuned models improving accuracy ~5% and reducing toxicity ~8%, reduced time-to-apply by 60% and increased weekly applications 300%, refurbished 800+ devices, and a 96% cohort graduation rate. Language is predominantly active and demonstrates scalability (1M+ records, CI/CD, Postgres+pgvector). Shortcomings: several bullets remain metric-less or vague (e.g., “designed and presented” or roles with no numerical outcome) and a few metrics are approximate, so minor deduction for incomplete numeric specificity. Overall aligns strongly with evaluation criteria.
CredTail: High alignment: all education entries (Master of Science – Data Science and Machine Learning, City University of New York – SPS, Expected Jan 2026; Bachelor of Technology – Computer Information Systems, CUNY NYC College of Technology, Jun 2024) are present and match the Retrieval Context. All four experience entries (Solutions Architect Intern — Amazon Web Services, Arlington VA, Jun 2025–Sep 2025; Software Developer Intern — WOPLLI Technologies, Jun 2024–Sep 2024; IT Support Intern — Mayor’s Office of Information Services, Feb 2024–May 2024; IT Instructor Assistant — RF CUNY & Generation USA, Feb 2022–Aug 2023) match exactly including dates and highlights. Core technologies and skills (Python + libs, SQL/NoSQL, AWS services including Bedrock/SageMaker/Glue/QuickSight, Azure services, FastAPI, Docker, Postgre/Postgres+pgvector, CI/CD, etc.) are all present in the Retrieval Context. Minor surface differences (project label GPT-4 Mini vs GPT-4.1 mini, spelling/typo differences like “Clusering” vs “Clustering”) are non-substantive and supported by the artifacts. No clear fabrications or missing critical fields were found, so no penalties applied. Category scores: Education 10, Experience 10, Core Skills 10.

Tone: High professionalism: well-formatted, grammatical resume with clear headings, contact links, and consistent bullets. Strongly action-oriented: uses active verbs (Designed, Built, Automated, Fine-tuned) and includes quantified outcomes (1M+ records, 5× faster feedback loops, ~5% accuracy gain, ~8% toxicity reduction, 60% faster application time). Excellent persona alignment: role- and industry-specific keywords and tools (AWS services including Glue/Bedrock/SageMaker, FastAPI, LLMs, QuickSight) that match a Solutions Architect / ML-focused candidate. Minor nitpick: no explicit target job title in the header, but overall strengths dominate.
Alignment: Step 1 extraction: required items from the JD include: senior/principal technical leadership (design full system architecture, provide technical leadership), 10+ years experience, BS/MS (or equivalent), strong OO languages (Java, GoLang, C#), networking protocols (TCP/IP, HTTP), databases/NoSQL/distributed persistence, troubleshooting/performance tuning, frontend (HTML/CSS/JS/TS + React/Vue/Angular) and UX tools (Figma), large-scale highly distributed/cloud-scale services, operational/missions-critical livesite experience, measurable delivery/SDLC. Step 2 comparison (explicit / partial / no evidence) with citations from the resume: - Technical leadership / Principal role: no evidence — resume has no Principal title or senior leadership bullets. - 10+ years experience: no evidence — internships (Jun 2024–Sep 2025) and recent BTech (Jun 2024). - Degree: partial evidence — BTech (Computer Information Systems, Jun 2024) meets BS requirement but MS is only expected Jan 2026 (“Master of Science – … Expected Jan 2026”). - OO languages: explicit evidence — “Programming Languages: … GoLang, C#,” and Java listed. - Networking protocols (TCP/IP, HTTP): no explicit evidence — networking protocols not mentioned. - Databases / NoSQL / distributed persistence: explicit evidence — “Databases: PostgreSQL, Oracle, MySQL, MongoDB, DynamoDB, NoSQL” and AWS services (DynamoDB, RDS). - Troubleshooting / performance tuning: partial evidence — “Automated troubleshooting workflows via Python scripts” and performance improvements in projects (e.g., “5× faster feedback loops”). - Frontend & UX tools: partial/no evidence — “HTML, CSS, JavaScript” present but no React/TypeScript/UX tools or Figma cited. - Large-scale, cloud-scale services & operations: partial evidence — AWS architecture experience and “secure, scalable AWS reference architectures” and pipeline processing “1M+ records,” but all are from internship roles (not clearly mission-critical or long-running ops). - Measurable outcomes / SDLC: explicit evidence in projects (e.g., “Automated a sentiment-analysis pipeline processing 1M+ records,” “5× faster feedback loops,” “improving accuracy by ~5%”). Step 3 penalties/rewards: resume includes several matching tools (GoLang, C#, AWS, DynamoDB, Oracle) and measurable metrics, which is positive. Major shortcomings: lacks seniority/10+ years and Principal-level leadership, no company/title-specific tailoring to Oracle or a Principal/MS role, missing explicit networking protocol experience and UX/Figma, and most achievements are from internships — treated as limited operational scope. Overall assessment per rubric: mostly tool overlap but critical gaps in required seniority, leadership, and some required skills; alignment is weak. Key missing elements driving this score: absence of 10+ years, no Principal title/leadership evidence, no TCP/IP/HTTP mention, no Figma/UX tooling.
Impact: Strong use of active, action-oriented language (e.g., Designed, Built, Automated, Fine-tuned) and multiple concrete metrics (processed 1M+ records; 5× faster feedback loops; ~5% accuracy improvement; ~8% toxicity reduction; 60% faster time-to-apply; 96% cohort graduation; 100+ tickets serviced). These bullets tie actions to clear outcomes (faster feedback, better model accuracy, reduced application time). Points deducted because several items remain vague or lack direct business KPIs (no $ revenue/cost impact or retention figures) and a few bullets (e.g., “presented reference architectures,” “POCs delivering actionable sentiment insights”) don’t quantify business impact.
CredTail: High fidelity to the Retrieval Context: name, contact details, summary, employers and dates for all four experience entries (AWS Solutions Architect Intern Jun 2025–Sep 2025; WOPLLI Jun 2024–Sep 2024; Mayor’s Office Feb 2024–May 2024; RF CUNY & Generation USA Feb 2022–Aug 2023) match exactly. Project “Alfred” description and most technologies (FastAPI, Docker, CI/CD, GitHub ingestion, PostgreSQL/pgvector references in highlights) are present in the context. Education (MS expected Jan 2026 with 4.0 GPA; B.Tech Jun 2024 with 3.78) and listed certifications also match. Shortcomings / unverified claims: several programming languages listed in Core Skills in the Actual Output (Java, GoLang, C#, JavaScript, HTML, CSS) do not appear in the Retrieval Context and are therefore unverified/fabricated. Minor inconsistencies/omissions: Actual lists “GPT-4 Mini” while Retrieval lists “GPT-4.1 mini” (small mismatch), and Retrieval includes R Programming which is omitted from the Actual Output’s core-skills list. Penalty rationale: core items (degrees, employers, dates, project and cloud/ML accomplishments) are fully verified so only modest penalty for the additional unverified programming languages and small terminology mismatches. Overall score reflects mostly-verified profile with a few fabricated/omitted technical claims.",343,2025-12-19 05:39:49.555797,9,8
248,3,P0,9.782608695652174,10,7,45.78260869565217,"Punctuality: The score is 0.98 because the only contradiction is that the retrieval context contains conflicting phone numbers: the structured profile lists 347-491-2955 while the artifacts contact block lists 929-305-7353, so the correct phone number is unclear from the provided context.
Tone: Professionalism rated 5: resume is well-formatted and consistent with clear headings, dates, bullets, and correct grammar. Action-Oriented rated 5: uses strong action verbs and many quantified results (e.g., automated pipeline processing 1M+ records, 5× faster feedback loops, ~5% accuracy gain, ~8% toxicity reduction, 96% cohort graduation). Persona Alignment rated 5: content and vocabulary align tightly with AWS/ML/Solutions Architect roles (Bedrock, SageMaker, Glue/Athena, FastAPI, RAG) and target audience expectations. Average of the three dimensions is 5.0; mapped to a 0–10 scale yields the top score. No inconsistency across dimensions (max–min difference = 0).
Alignment: Checklist extracted: responsibilities (design/build/maintain scalable data systems & pipelines, data modeling, ETL workflows, optimize storage, support data warehousing, cross-functional collaboration), tools (Python, ETL tools, data warehousing tools, SQL/NoSQL, AWS), and outcomes/metrics (scalable throughput, quantified pipeline improvements). Comparison: Explicit matches — strong Python, ETL tools (Glue, SSIS), AWS stack (Athena/Glue/Lambda/RDS/QuickSight/SageMaker) and automated pipelines with measurable results (1M+ records, 5× faster feedback). Partial matches — data modeling and data warehousing experience implied (Glue/Athena/RDS/QuickSight) but not clearly framed as warehouse design/optimization or storage-solution tuning. Missing — mandatory domain expertise in global financial instruments (equities, fixed income, options, exotics) is absent; explicit optimization of data storage solutions and collaboration with cross-functional teams are not demonstrated. Customization: resume is generic for data roles and does not mention DL Software Inc. or the Data Engineer title. Given several direct tool/responsibility matches and some quantified outcomes but key domain and company-specific requirements missing, the score reflects moderate alignment.
Impact: Strong presence of explicit, quantified results (multiple metrics such as a pipeline processing 1M+ records, 5× faster feedback loops, ~5% accuracy gain and ~8% toxicity reduction, 36 lessons for 200+ learners, 96% graduation rate) satisfies the metrics requirement. Language is action-oriented with verbs like Designed, Built, Automated, and Fine-tuned, showing clear agency. Business linkage is present via efficiency and performance outcomes (faster feedback loops, reduced manual workload), though financial impact or some baseline/timeframe details are missing for a few claims and a few phrases are somewhat buzzwordy. Overall weighting favors metrics and active language, so the output scores highly with a small deduction for minor vagueness.

Tone: High professionalism: clean header, clear sections, consistent formatting, and professional tone (contact details, summary, skills, experience, education, certifications). Strongly action-oriented: uses active verbs and quantified outcomes (automated pipeline processing 1M+ records, 5× faster feedback loops, ~5% accuracy improvement, 8% toxicity reduction, 96% cohort graduation). Strong persona alignment: excellent match for an AWS/ML Solutions Architect role with explicit Bedrock/SageMaker/Glue/QuickSight experience, relevant internships, and certifications. No relative gaps of 1 point or more across the component scores.
Alignment: Strong matches: explicit Python, modern architectural patterns, AWS (Bedrock, SageMaker), ML/LLMs, performance optimization, and measurable outcomes (1M+ record pipeline, 5× faster feedback loops, ~5% accuracy gain, -8% toxicity). Location aligns with New York and relevant tools (FastAPI, Docker, DynamoDB/MongoDB) are present. Key gaps: no explicit mention of vector databases (e.g., FAISS/Pinecone/Milvus), the resume uses internship titles rather than a Senior Software Engineer title or clear senior-level ownership, and it doesn’t reference the employer (Robert Half). These omissions reduce alignment with the senior role’s expectations despite strong technical relevance.
Impact: Strong use of action verbs and multiple concrete metrics across bullets (e.g., “Automated a sentiment-analysis pipeline processing 1M+ records” with “5× faster feedback loops”; “fine-tuned models… improving accuracy by ~5% and reducing toxicity by ~8%”; “36 lessons…200+ learners” and “96% cohort graduation rate”; “100+ tickets” support). These tie to clear outcomes (real-time dashboards, model quality gains, cohort success). However several bullets remain vague or lack quantification (POCs with Bedrock/Athena, reference architecture presentations, API/vendor management, “reduced manual workload” without percent), which warrants a modest penalty for missing measurable impact. Overall strong metric presence but not fully consistent across all bullets.
CredTail: High fidelity: every claimed employer (AWS, WOPLLI, Mayor's Office of Information Services, RF CUNY & Generation USA) and their employment dates (Jun 2025–Sep 2025; Jun 2024–Sep 2024; Feb 2024–May 2024; Feb 2022–Aug 2023) appear verbatim in the Retrieval Context. Both degrees (M.S. Data Science & Machine Learning — Expected Jan 2026; B.Tech Computer Information Systems — Jun 2024) and listed honors/GPA are present. Core technologies and services (Python with pandas/scikit-learn/PyTorch, SQL/NoSQL, AWS: EC2/S3/Lambda/RDS/DynamoDB/Glue/QuickSight/Bedrock/Macie/SageMaker, Azure App Service/Functions/Storage, FastAPI, Docker, Git, CI/CD, Power BI, etc.) match entries in the Retrieval Context. Certifications listed are also present. No fabricated or contradictory items were found; therefore no penalties applied.",323,2025-12-19 05:41:13.333617,8,10
250,1063,P0,10,5,3,36,"Punctuality: The score is 1.00 because the Contradictions list is empty (""[]""), showing no discrepancies between the actual output and the retrieval context—well done!
Tone: Assigned scores — Professionalism: 5 (clean, well-structured resume with complete contact info and headings); Action-Oriented: 5 (strong action verbs and measurable impacts, e.g., “automated sentiment-analysis pipeline processing 1M+ records,” “5× faster feedback loops,” “reduced time to apply by 60%”); Persona Alignment: 5 (content aligns with a solutions-focused technologist—AWS services, Bedrock/SageMaker work, agentic AI project ‘Alfred’). Comparison: all three scores are equal, so no significant imbalance (difference <2). Consistency: Action-Oriented and Persona Alignment logically support Professionalism with quantified results and relevant technologies. Average = 5.0.
Alignment: Base alignment computed from weighted matches: responsibilities weak (only partial matches for Azure deployment, optimization, troubleshooting; major responsibilities absent—no React/Node.js, no OAuth, no explicit code-review/product-manager collaboration), tools/technologies limited match (explicit Azure App Service/Functions/Storage, Agile/Scrum, Docker/Git, REST/FastAPI; key requested tech absent: React, Node.js, OAuth, Highcharts), outcomes strong (multiple quantified results: 1M+ record pipeline, 5× faster feedback loops, ~5% accuracy uplift/8% toxicity reduction, 60% time reduction and 300% application increase). Converted weighted match to a mid-low base score, then applied a specificity penalty because the resume is generic and not tailored to the Eliassen Senior Software Engineer role/title, and added a small positive adjustment for the concrete, quantified achievements and named cloud/tools. Matched: Azure deployment, Agile, CI/CD, APIs, quantified metrics. Partially matched: data-visualization skills (QuickSight/Power BI vs requested Highcharts), optimization/troubleshooting/security. Missing: React, Node.js, OAuth, Highcharts, explicit front-office/financial-services experience, code review & PM/design collaboration. Final score reflects these matches, gaps, and adjustments.
Impact: The output contains multiple clear action verbs paired with measurable results and business impact (e.g., “Automated a sentiment-analysis pipeline processing 1M+ records” with “5× faster feedback loops,” fine‑tuned models improving accuracy ~5% and reducing toxicity ~8%, Alfred project reducing time-to-apply by 60% and boosting weekly applications by 300%, 96% cohort graduation rate, refurbished 800+ devices, delivered 36 lessons to 200+ learners). These demonstrate explicit metrics and outcomes (falls in the 7–9 band). It is not exceptional because several items remain vague or unquantified (e.g., “Designed and presented secure, scalable AWS reference architectures,” vendor management, and some Azure/configuration bullets), so a small deduction is applied for missing numeric specificity and occasional non-measurable statements.
CredTail: All major claims are supported by the Retrieval Context. Education: both degrees (M.S. Data Science & Machine Learning at CUNY SPS, expected Jan 2026, GPA 4.0; B.Tech Computer Information Systems at CUNY NYC College of Technology, Jun 2024, GPA 3.78, honors) match exactly. Experience: all four roles and dates (Solutions Architect Intern – AWS, Jun 2025–Sep 2025; Software Developer Intern – WOPLLI, Jun 2024–Sep 2024; IT Support Intern – Mayor’s Office, Feb 2024–May 2024; IT Instructor Assistant – RF CUNY & Generation USA, Feb 2022–Aug 2023) and their highlights are present and consistent. Core Skills: detailed technology list (Python libs, AWS services including Bedrock/SageMaker/Glue/QuickSight, Azure items, Postgre/pgvector, FastAPI, OpenAI GPT-4.1 mini, etc.) aligns with the structured core_skills and project tech. No clear fabrications found; no critical fields (degree, employer, dates) are missing. Minor issues: small typos in the Retrieval Context (e.g., “Clusering” vs “Clustering”) and an alternate phone number appears in an artifact but the Structured Profile phone matches the Actual Output—these are minor and do not warrant deduction. Therefore no penalties were applied.",282,2025-12-19 05:42:37.601072,8,10
251,632,P1,9.411764705882353,10,3,36.411764705882355,"Punctuality: The score is 0.94 because the actual output incorrectly lists WOPLLI Technologies Software Developer Intern dates as “Jun 2024 – Present” instead of the retrieval context’s “Jun 2024 – Sep 2024,” and it understates Darwhin’s device work by claiming “over 400 devices” whereas the context reports refurbished/tracked over 800 devices with VIP support and white‑glove handling of 100+ tickets.
Tone: The resume is highly professional: clean formatting, consistent headings, correct grammar, and clear contact/education/skills sections. It is strongly action-oriented with many active verbs and quantified results in projects (e.g., Alfred: 60% reduction in time-to-apply, 300% increase in weekly applications) and concise achievement statements. Persona alignment is excellent for data science/software roles — relevant technical skills (Python, SQL, AWS), ML/data projects, and appropriate education. Minor shortcoming: internship bullets lack deeper technical metrics or specific tools used and could include direct project links or outcomes. All three evaluated areas are essentially tied at a high level.
Alignment: Extracted JD requirements: in-depth business analysis, lead independent deep analyses, exploratory analysis (anomaly attribution, trend interpretation), synthesize market/internal data, build/clean business databases, drive cross-departmental action; tools/tech: SQL, Excel, mainstream BI, Python/R; outcomes: 5+ years, multiple mature projects, persuasive insight decks driving decisions. Resume comparison: explicit evidence for tools — Technical Skills lists “Python, R, SQL” and “Data Visualization (QuickSight, Power BI)” and projects cite “Designed a PostgreSQL schema” and “Created ERD models, normalized tables” (explicit matches). Partial evidence for database/building and analytics — projects (Alfred: “Built pipelines…”, “PostgreSQL schema”, “reducing time to apply by 60%”) show technical impact but are not business-domain analyses tied to strategic KPIs. No evidence for key JD requirements: seniority/experience (resume shows internships and a 2024 bachelor’s, not 5+ years), no mention of Excel, no evidence of producing high-level business insight decks used to drive decisions, no logistics/domain experience or company/title tailoring (no “Senior Data Analyst”/“UniUni Logistics”), and limited cross-department leadership or mature project rollouts. Penalized for templated/generic presentation and lack of measurable business outcomes aligned to company strategy. These gaps (seniority, domain, Excel, proven business-decision influence) drove a weak-alignment score.
Impact: Strong use of active, action-oriented language (Implemented, Built, Designed, Developed, Created, Delivered) and numerous measurable results (60% time reduction and 300% increase for Alfred; 65,000+ records; support for 400+ devices; 36 lessons to 200+ learners; 96% graduation rate). Business impact is clear for the Alfred project (time saved and higher application volume) and some project outputs. Deductions for several vague or generic experience bullets that lack quantified outcomes or business impact (e.g., “Researched technical white papers and created presentations,” “Collaborated on application feature design,” “Assisted in hardware and software updates”), which reduce clarity on accomplishments. Overall strong metrics and active phrasing but not consistently tied to business outcomes across all bullets.
CredTail: Verified items: name, email, phone, LinkedIn, location, both degrees (Master’s expected Jan 2026 and B.Tech Jun 2024) with matching GPAs/honors, IT Support Intern (Feb–May 2024) and IT Instructor Assistant (Feb 2022–Aug 2023) entries, and the Alfred project details (FastAPI, embeddings, PostgreSQL, cosine-similarity, 60%/300% metrics) align with the Retrieval Context. Missing items: the Solutions Architect Intern at AWS (Jun–Sep 2025) present in the Retrieval Context is omitted; several high-value AWS services and data tools from the retrieval (Glue, Bedrock, SageMaker, DynamoDB, pgvector) and listed certifications are not included in the Actual Output. Inconsistencies/fabrications: the Software Developer Intern at WOPLLI has a date conflict (Retrieval: Jun–Sep 2024 vs Actual: Jun 2024–Present), and two projects (Financial Stocks Report, EZRental) are not present in the Retrieval Context and should be treated as unverified/fabricated. Penalties applied for omitted high-priority cloud/ML technologies and fabricated projects reduce credibility, though core education and several experiences/projects are accurate.",348,2025-12-19 05:42:38.783983,8,6
252,1094,P1,10,10,5,42,"Punctuality: The score is 1.00 because the contradictions list is empty, indicating there are no inconsistencies and the actual output fully aligns with the retrieval context—well done!
Tone: Professionalism: highly polished resume formatting and tone with clear sections (contact, summary, education, skills, experience, projects). Action-oriented: uses strong verbs and quantified outcomes (e.g., automated pipeline processing 1M+ records, 5× faster feedback loops, ~5% accuracy gain, ~8% toxicity reduction, 96% cohort graduation). Persona alignment: excellent match to Solutions Architect/Data Science roles with relevant AWS services (Bedrock, Glue, Athena, SageMaker), FastAPI/RAG, pgvector, and ML coursework. All three sub-scores would be top-rated with no relative gaps (no >=1-point differences), indicating consistent strengths and no major shortcomings.
Alignment: Matches: strong technical tool alignment (AWS services, FastAPI/REST, Docker, Git), multiple languages (Python, JavaScript, C/C++, Java, Swift, Kotlin), experience architecting scalable systems and data pipelines, measurable outcomes (processed 1M+ records, 5× faster feedback loops, ~5% accuracy gain, ~8% toxicity reduction, 96% cohort grad rate). Missing/weak: does not meet Meta’s stated experience requirement (no 6+ years or senior track record), limited evidence of product-level ownership/setting technical direction or leading cross-functional product efforts, little on frontend/UI implementation for mobile/web, sparse detail on test/unit testing, code reviews, rollout/monitoring at production scale, and no explicit use of Meta/product-specific language. Specificity/relevance: resume is technically strong but generic to Meta’s Product role (no Meta mention, limited product leadership examples). Overall, solid technical fit for many required tools but significant gaps on seniority, product ownership, and production-quality processes.
Impact: Strong use of action verbs and multiple measurable bullets across the resume (e.g., automated sentiment pipeline processing 1M+ records with 5× faster feedback loops; fine-tuned SageMaker models improving accuracy ~5% and reducing toxicity ~8%; IT instructor: 36 lessons for 200+ learners with a 96% graduation rate; over 100 support tickets handled). These tie to clear outcomes (time-to-feedback, model quality, graduation rate). Shortcomings: several bullets remain vague or lack business impact metrics (e.g., “designed and presented secure, scalable AWS reference architectures,” POCs combining Bedrock without explicit impact, Virtual Credential System work, and soft-skill claims like “excellent communication”), so I deducted points per the guideline on vague language. Overall, strong metric density but not uniformly tied to business outcomes across all bullets, and a small penalty applied for non-quantified/ambiguous items.

Penalized/mismatched items: several programming languages listed in the Actual Output (C, C++, Swift, Kotlin) do not appear in the Retrieval Context and are treated as unsupported/missing — minor deduction for unsupported core-language claims. No employers, dates, or major technologies appear fabricated or contradictory. Final score reflects high fidelity with a small penalty for the unsupported language entries.",328,2025-12-19 05:44:27.575895,8,9

Tone: Professionalism: 4/5 — Resume is well-structured with clear headings, contact links, and consistent sections (Summary, Core Competencies, Experience, Projects, Education, Certifications). Minor formatting inconsistencies and small typos (e.g., punctuation variance in bullets, “Postgre”) prevent a perfect score. Action-Oriented: 5/5 — Strong action verbs and many quantified outcomes (e.g., automated pipeline processing 1M+ records, 5× faster feedback loops, ~5% accuracy gain and ~8% toxicity reduction, 60% faster application time, 300% more applications) and result-focused phrasing throughout experience and projects. Persona Alignment: 5/5 — Tone, vocabulary, and emphasis strongly match a solutions-architect/data/ML persona (AWS services, Bedrock, SageMaker, LLMs, CI/CD, analytics), and internships/projects align with audience expectations. Average of the three dimensions is 4.7. Highest vs lowest difference is 1.0, so no tone inconsistency flagged.
Alignment: The resume shows clear tool matches for cloud and data technologies from the JD (AWS services including Bedrock, Glue, Lambda, SageMaker; NoSQL/DynamoDB; CI/CD; databases including Oracle/MongoDB) and includes strong quantified outcomes (1M+ records, 5× faster feedback, % model improvements). However it omits several core JD requirements: no experience with Java/Go/C# or explicit TCP/IP/HTTP networking familiarity, no front-end frameworks/UX tools (React/Angular/Figma) listed, and lacks mission-critical operational / 10+ years / Principal-level seniority or any Oracle/Principal title customization. Troubleshooting/performance tuning and large-scale resilient services are only partially evidenced (intern/P0C experience). Given these explicit matches, partials, and significant seniority/customization gaps, the alignment is limited.
Impact: Strong alignment: the output includes multiple explicit numerical results (e.g., pipeline processing 1M+ records, 5× faster feedback loops, model accuracy +~5%, toxicity -~8%, time-to-apply -60%, applications +300%, 36 lessons for 200+ learners, 96% graduation, 800 devices refurbished), satisfying the ≥2-quantified-outcomes requirement. Language is action-oriented with clear agency (designed, built, automated, fine-tuned, delivered), earning high marks on action wording. Business impact is clearly linked to efficiency, feedback speed, model quality, and growth (increased applications), though few items lack direct revenue or cost-savings figures and some metrics omit explicit baselines/timeframes. Weighing the metrics (50%), action language (30%), and business linkage (20%) with minor penalties for those omissions yields a high score.
CredTail: Nearly every claim in the Actual Output is directly supported by the Retrieval Context. Personal info (name, location, email, phone, LinkedIn, GitHub) matches the Structured Profile personal_info. The Summary and Core Competencies map to core_skills (including AWS services such as Bedrock, Glue, SageMaker; Python libraries; Azure items; databases). Each Professional Experience entry and dates (Solutions Architect Intern at AWS Jun 2025–Sep 2025; Software Developer Intern at WOPLLI Jun 2024–Sep 2024; IT Support Intern Feb 2024–May 2024; IT Instructor Feb 2022–Aug 2023) and their highlights are present in experience[]. The Alfred project details and tech stack align with projects[]. Education entries and dates (MSc expected Jan 2026; BTech Jun 2024) and honors are in education[]. Certifications are listed in certifications[]. I found no contradicted or fabricated items and no substantive missing claims relative to the Retrieval Context, so no deductions were applied to the starting credibility score.",342,2025-12-19 05:45:34.985465,9,10

Tone: Assigned top marks across criteria: Professionalism (5) for clear, well-structured formatting, complete contact info, and polished language; Action-Oriented (5) for numerous quantified impacts (e.g., “1M+ records,” “5× faster feedback loops,” “60% time reduction,” “300% increase,” model accuracy/toxicity deltas); Persona Alignment (5) because skills, certifications, AWS/Bedrock/SageMaker work and the Alfred project strongly match the stated solutions-focused technologist/Generative AI persona. The three scores are balanced with no significant mismatches, and Action-Oriented and Persona Alignment consistently support Professionalism. Average = 5.0.
Alignment: Following the evaluation steps: Responsibilities — partial match (designing backend/AWS architectures, building pipelines, end-to-end project ownership on the Alfred project), explicit match (analyzing/improving efficiency with quantified improvements like 1M+ records processed and 5× faster feedback), but missing design/code review evidence and limited explicit production component ownership at large scope. Tools/Technologies — partial match: strong Python and extensive AWS/Azure/CI-CD/DB tooling listed (FastAPI, SageMaker, Bedrock, Docker, Git, PostgreSQL/pgvector), but key required languages PHP, Hack, and C++ are absent. Outcomes/Metrics — strong match with multiple quantified results (5× speedup, +5% accuracy, −8% toxicity, 60% time reduction, 300% application increase, 96% cohort graduation). Base weighted match ≈61% → base score ≈7. Specificity penalty applied (resume is generic/not tailored to Meta) −2. Concrete evidence bonus for named tools and multiple quantified outcomes +1. Final score reflects matched items (Python, AWS/infra, measurable outcomes), partial matches (backend design, team interfacing, ownership), and missing items (PHP/Hack/C++, design/code reviews, required Master's not yet completed).
Impact: Strong use of action verbs and numerous explicit metrics and business outcomes (e.g., automated pipeline processing 1M+ records with 5× faster feedback loops; fine‑tuned models improving accuracy by ~5% and reducing toxicity by ~8%; reduced time‑to‑apply by 60% and increased weekly applications by 300%; 96% cohort graduation rate; refurbished 800+ devices). These demonstrate measurable impact and clear context. Minor shortcomings: several bullets lack outcome metrics or ROI (e.g., “Designed and presented secure, scalable AWS reference architectures” and some POC descriptions), and a few metrics use approximations (~) rather than precise figures. Overall high measurability with small gaps in consistency of numeric specificity.
CredTail: Step 1: All major claims in the Actual Output are present and match the Retrieval Context: education entries (M.S. Data Science & ML, City University of New York – SPS, expected Jan 2026; B.Tech Computer Information Systems, CUNY NYC College of Technology, Jun 2024 with stated GPAs/honors) are supported. Experience entries (Solutions Architect Intern at Amazon Web Services, Arlington VA, Jun 2025–Sep 2025; Software Developer Intern at WOPLLI Technologies, Jun 2024–Sep 2024; IT Support Intern at Mayor’s Office of Information Services, Feb 2024–May 2024; IT Instructor Assistant at RF CUNY & Generation USA, Feb 2022–Aug 2023) and their dates and highlights match the Retrieval Context. Core technologies and competencies (Python with listed libs, SQL/NoSQL, detailed AWS services including Bedrock/SageMaker/Glue/QuickSight, Azure services, FastAPI, PostgreSQL+pgvector, Docker, CI/CD, etc.) correspond to the retrieval. Step 2: Given full support across Education, Experience, and Core Skills, each category merits top credibility. Step 3: No clear fabrications or missing critical fields were found in the Retrieval Context to the Actual Output; therefore no penalty applied. Summary: strong 1:1 alignment on degrees, institutions, employers, dates, and enumerated technologies; no contradictions or missing/fabricated critical items detected.",287,2025-12-19 05:46:39.898203,8,10
255,682,P1,9.032258064516128,9,6,39.03225806451613,"Punctuality: The score is 0.90 because the actual output contains three concrete contradictions with the retrieval context: it lists a different phone number (structured profile 347-491-2955 vs Artifacts 929-305-7353), it misstates the Mayor's Office IT Support Intern dates as 'Feb 2024 – Current' instead of Feb 2024–May 2024, and it underreports device work as 'restoring over 400 devices' while the profile says refurbishing/tracking over 800 devices.
Tone: The resume demonstrates excellent persona alignment with a data/ETL role — clear ETL/SQL/tool listings and projects (Alfred, stock reports, POS) with measurable outcomes (restored 400+ devices, 60% reduction in time-to-apply, 96% graduation rate). Professionalism is strong overall with clean headings, consistent bullets, and correct grammar, though there are minor issues like header spacing and occasional tense/passive phrasing. Action-orientation is good: many action verbs and quantified results appear, but a few bullets (e.g., “Developed Python scripts”) lack explicit impact metrics. Strongest area: persona alignment. Weakest areas: professionalism and action-orientation (minor phrasing and missing impact specifics).
Alignment: Step 1 — Extracted JD evaluation criteria: Responsibilities: data integration & RPA/workflow development; create/maintain BI reports (SSRS & Power BI); design/develop/maintain SQL queries & stored procedures; analyze business cases & collaborate with stakeholders; implement solutions using ASP.Net, IIS, SSIS, Okta API, Workato, C#, SSAS, REST/SOAP, JSON, XML, Visual Studio 2022; manage data processing & SFTP transfers; design SSIS packages for complex ETL/migrations; follow change management/code review/documentation/testing; attend departmental/technical meetings; Master’s + 3 years experience. Required tools/tech: SSRS, SSAS, SSIS, IIS Server, SFTP, SQL Server development, REST API/SOAP, JSON, XML, .NET/C#, RPA tools.

Step 2 — Comparison (explicit / partial / no evidence) with cited resume text:
- ETL & SSIS: Partial evidence — core skills list includes “ETL/ELT: SSIS” and summary says “experience in ETL processes.” No explicit bullet describing designing complex SSIS packages or migrations.
- BI reports (Power BI / SSRS): Partial evidence — core skills lists “Power BI” and summary: “Proficient in creating business intelligence reports.” SSRS is not listed (no evidence).
- SQL development & stored procedures: Explicit evidence for general SQL dev — “SQL Development: SQL Server” and project: “Developed efficient SQL scripts and queries.” No explicit mention of stored procedures or reporting-specific stored procs.
- REST/SOAP, JSON/XML, APIs: Partial evidence — core skills list “APIs: REST, SOAP.” JSON and XML are not explicitly mentioned.
- .NET/C#, ASP.Net, IIS, Visual Studio: No evidence — resume lacks references to “C#,” “ASP.Net,” “IIS,” or “Visual Studio 2022.”
- RPA / workflow automation: Partial/weak evidence — resume shows “Developed Python scripts to automate troubleshooting workflows” and automation skills “Python, CI/CD,” but no RPA platform (e.g., Workato, UiPath) or robotic process automation tools listed.
- SFTP & production data processing operations: No evidence — no mention of “SFTP,” production issue handling, or managed data-processing ops.
- Change management / code review / testing / documentation: No explicit evidence of these development standards.
- Collaboration / meetings / stakeholder analysis: Partial evidence — bullets state “Communicate with team members at all levels”; project outcomes indicate teamwork, but no explicit “departmental/committee & technical meetings” or business-case analysis phrasing.
- Education & experience requirement (Master’s + 3 years): No/negative evidence — resume shows “Master of Science – Data Science and Machine Learning Expected Graduation: Jan 2026” (not completed) and limited professional experience (intern and instructor assistant), not 3 years of senior IT development experience.
- Measurable outcomes: Strength — resume provides concrete metrics such as “restore over 400 out-of-commission devices,” “96% cohort graduation rate,” and “reducing time to apply by 60%.”

Step 3 — Templating and penalties: The resume is moderately specific (lists SSIS, Power BI, SQL Server, REST/SOAP and measurable project metrics) but lacks job/company-specific tailoring (no reference to Touro University or the Senior ETL & Data Analyst title) and omits many must-have enterprise tools (SSRS, SSAS, IIS, .NET/C#, SFTP, Okta API, Workato, Visual Studio 2022, explicit JSON/XML, RPA platforms). Also fails the required Master’s + 3 years criterion.

Scoring rationale (per guide): The resume shows moderate alignment with several core skills (SSIS, Power BI, SQL Server, REST/SOAP, ETL experience and measurable outcomes) but misses critical required technologies, senior experience and formal degree completion, and lacks SSRS/SSAS/IIS/.NET/SFTP/RPA tooling. These significant omissions drove a moderate-but-not-strong alignment score.
Impact: Strong use of active, action-oriented language (e.g., Developed Python scripts, Delivered 36 lessons, Implemented GitHub ingestion) and multiple measurable results (restored over 400 devices, 36 lessons for 200+ learners, 96% graduation rate, 60% reduction in time-to-apply, 65,000+ records) align well with Steps 1–2. The resume ties actions to business outcomes like operational efficiency and time savings, but it falls short of explicit revenue/cost/retention impact and includes several vague bullets (e.g., “Provide support…,” “enhancing operational efficiency,” “Developed efficient SQL scripts”) that lack quantification or clear business impact as required by Step 3–4. Overall, strong metrics and active phrasing with minor deductions for vagueness and missing direct business outcome metrics.
CredTail: Verified items: education (M.S. Data Science & ML expected Jan 2026 with 4.0; B.Tech CIS Jun 2024 with 3.78 and honors), certifications (both AWS certs and two Google certs), core technologies like SSIS, AWS Glue, Python, Power BI, QuickSight, PostgreSQL/MySQL, and the Alfred FastAPI/OpenAI project, plus the IT Instructor role (dates and metrics match Retrieval Context). Missing/contradictory items: Mayor’s Office internship dates and device count conflict with the Retrieval Context (Actual lists Feb 2024–Current and ~400 devices vs Retrieval’s Feb 2024–May 2024 and ~800 devices). Fabricated or unsupported claims: SOAP under APIs is not in the Retrieval Context, and the Financial Stocks Report and EzRental projects do not appear in the Retrieval Context. Also, several notable Retrieval Context roles (AWS Solutions Architect Intern; WOPLLI Software Developer Intern) are present in the source but omitted from the Actual Output. Given that most core skills, education, certifications, and the main project are accurately reflected but there are several concrete fabrications/contradictions and omissions (prioritizing core-tech and experience inconsistencies), the response is largely credible with moderate penalties applied.",353,2025-12-19 05:46:44.895273,8,7
256,1068,P1,10,10,4,43,"Punctuality: The score is 1.00 because the Contradictions list is empty, indicating no mismatches between the actual output and the retrieval context — great job keeping the response fully faithful!
Tone: Professionalism is strong: clean formatting, clear summary, contact links, and polished sectioning (education, skills, experience, projects). Action-oriented language is evident with many strong verbs and multiple quantified outcomes (processed 1M+ records, 5× faster feedback loops, ~5% accuracy improvement, ~8% toxicity reduction, 60% reduction in time-to-apply, 96% cohort graduation rate). Persona alignment is excellent for cloud/ML/solutions-architect roles — AWS services (Bedrock, Athena, Glue, SageMaker), agentic AI tooling, and relevant certifications match the target skillset. No relative gaps of one point or more were found between categories; weaknesses are minimal (minor consistency/chronology nitpicks), so overall alignment is very high.
Alignment: The resume matches several baseline requirements (Step 1): lists Linux/UNIX, Git, SQL, Java, Python, JavaScript, cloud/AWS experience, and a claimed background in distributed systems and scalable APIs. It also shows measurable outcomes (Step 3) — e.g., a pipeline processing 1M+ records, 5× faster feedback, ~5% model accuracy gain, 8% toxicity reduction, and a 96% cohort graduation rate — which demonstrate impact though primarily in data/cloud/ML contexts. Key gaps vs. the job (Step 1 & 2): no evidence of systems-level work (OS/kernel, compilers, network distribution, or building high‑volume servers), C++ is missing, core web tech like HTML/CSS is not shown, required tooling (VIM/Emacs, Subversion/Perforce) isn’t listed, and it’s unclear the candidate meets the 2+ years of relevant systems experience. The resume uses generic/cloud/ML language rather than Meta/Systems-specific phrasing and does not reference system-level codebases, development-to-release standards, or role-specific responsibilities (Step 2). Scoring balances these positives (relevant languages, Linux, Git, distributed claims, quantified outcomes) against critical missing systems qualifications and specificity, resulting in a below-average alignment score.
Impact: Strong presence of action-oriented verbs and multiple specific metrics tied to outcomes (e.g., automated sentiment pipeline processing 1M+ records with 5× faster feedback loops; fine-tuned models improving accuracy ~5% and reducing toxicity ~8%; reduced application time by 60%; 96% cohort graduation rate). These bullets link numbers to business/time impact. Minor deductions applied because several bullets remain vague or unquantified (e.g., Azure environment configuration, “Designed and presented” AWS architectures, and automated troubleshooting workflows with no measured workload reduction), so not every accomplishment includes a clear metric or business outcome.
CredTail: High fidelity: All claimed personal info (name, email, phone, location, LinkedIn, GitHub) appears verbatim in the Retrieval Context. Both education entries (M.S. Data Science & ML, CUNY SPS, Expected Jan 2026, GPA 4.0, Dean’s List 2x; B.Tech Computer Information Systems, NYC College of Technology, Jun 2024, GPA 3.78, Dean’s List 5x, National Honor Society) are present verbatim.

(Feb 2024 – Current)"" whereas the retrieval context clearly lists an IT Support Intern at the Mayor's Office of Information Services from Feb 2024 to May 2024 (not current).
Tone: Professionalism rated 4/5 — well-formatted resume-style layout, clear headings, complete contact links (email, phone, LinkedIn, GitHub), and generally correct grammar. Action-Oriented rated 5/5 — uses strong action verbs and includes quantified results (36 lessons, 200+ learners, 96% cohort graduation) and result-focused bullets. Persona Alignment rated 3/5 — summary calls out nursing/patient care and a desire to join a nursing environment, but the body is heavily technical (IT instructor, software intern, data science MS), producing mixed targeting; recommend aligning summary or adding healthcare-IT keywords and clinical-relevant outcomes. Average of the three category ratings is 4.0; strongest area is action-oriented content, weakest is persona alignment due to unclear target audience.
Alignment: Step 1 — JD extraction: Required responsibilities (from the posting): provide Registered Nurse clinical care in a rehabilitation hospital, contribute to patients’ recoveries, full-time night shift (7P–7A), benefits starting day one. Tools/technologies: none explicitly listed in the truncated JD. Desired outcomes/metrics: patient recovery/outcomes and likely staffing/shift coverage. Step 2 — comparison to resume: Mostly no evidence of clinical nursing alignment. Explicit/partial/no evidence per item: - Provide RN clinical care / rehab experience: NO EVIDENCE — resume contains no clinical roles, no hospital positions, no RN title or license. - Support patients’ recoveries / patient-care outcomes: PARTIAL EVIDENCE (soft skill only) — resume summary states “a passion for patient care.” - Full-time 7P–7A shift availability: NO EVIDENCE — no shift or availability details. - Tools/technologies (EMR, medical devices, meds administration): NO EVIDENCE — resume lists technical tools/certifications (AWS, Google cybersecurity) unrelated to nursing. - Measurable patient outcomes: NO EVIDENCE (clinical) — measurable outcome on resume is education-related: “Delivered 36 lessons … achieving a 96% cohort graduation rate,” which is not a clinical metric. Step 3 — templated/generic language and tailoring: Penalize heavy lack of tailoring — the resume is technology-focused (IT Instructor Assistant, Software Developer Intern, certifications like AWS) and does not reference the job title, Encompass Health, hospital work, RN licensure, or rehab nursing tasks. Strengths: clear transferable soft skills cited (e.g., “Communication: Proven ability…”, “Collaboration…”, “Customer Service: Experience…”), and one measurable outcome in teaching. Key missing elements driving the score: no RN credential or clinical experience, no hospital/rehab experience, no EMR or clinical tools, no shift/availability note, and no company/title-specific tailoring. Overall alignment falls in the “no meaningful alignment” category with minor transferable skills only.
Impact: Strong use of active, action-oriented language (e.g., “Delivered,” “Developed,” “Collaborated,” “Managed”) and inclusion of concrete metrics — 36 lessons to over 200 learners with a 96% cohort graduation rate — which earns credit for measurable results and clear educational outcome. However, several bullets are vague or lack measurable/business impact (e.g., “Developed comprehensive testing materials,” “Provide white glove service,” “Participate in projects,” and internship duties without %/time/cost/quality metrics), reducing clarity on broader business outcomes and making some accomplishments generic. Overall a solid, metric-backed resume with limited scope of quantified impact beyond the teaching role, so points are deducted for insufficient metrics and occasional vagueness.
CredTail: Verified items: personal contact info (name, email, phone, location), LinkedIn/GitHub URLs, IT Instructor Assistant (RF CUNY & Generation USA) with 36 lessons and 96% graduation rate, Software Developer Intern (WOPLLI Technologies) Jun 2024–Sep 2024, Bachelor (CUNY NYC College of Technology) Jun 2024 with GPA 3.78 and honors, Master’s expected Jan 2026 with GPA 4.0 and Dean’s List, and several certifications (AWS Solutions Architect, Google Cybersecurity, Google Information Support). Missing/omitted from Actual Output: extensive technical core skills listed in the Retrieval Context (Python libraries, SQL/NoSQL, detailed AWS services including Bedrock/SageMaker/Glue, FastAPI, PostgreSQL+pgvector, Docker, CI/CD, data-engineering/ML tooling), the Solutions Architect Intern role at Amazon Web Services (Jun 2025–Sep 2025) and the Alfred project (FastAPI, pgvector, OpenAI), and the AWS Certified AI Practitioner cert which appears in retrieval but is absent. Fabrications/inconsistencies: the Actual summary shifts to patient care/nursing (not in retrieval), the Mayor’s Office entry is labeled as a volunteer and shown as “Feb 2024 – Current” whereas retrieval shows “IT Support Intern” from Feb 2024–May 2024 (date/title contradiction). Penalties applied: major penalty for omission of core technical stack (highest priority), penalty for omitting AWS internship and project evidence, and penalties for the fabricated summary and date/title contradiction. These lead to a reduced credibility score.",358,2025-12-19 05:50:05.851378,7,4
258,1103,P0,10,10,7,47,"Punctuality: The score is 1.00 because the contradictions list is empty, indicating there are no discrepancies between the actual output and the retrieval context, so the output fully aligns with the provided information — well done.
Tone: Assigned scores — Professionalism: 5 (clear, well-structured resume; complete contact info, polished summary, education/certs listed); Action-Oriented: 5 (many quantified accomplishments and outcomes: automated pipeline processing 1M+ records, 5× faster dashboards, 60% faster application time, model accuracy/toxicity improvements); Persona Alignment: 5 (content consistently supports a “solutions-focused technologist” persona via AWS/Azure, generative AI projects, teaching and security work). No score differs by ≥2, so no significant imbalance; Action-Oriented and Persona Alignment logically reinforce Professionalism. Average of the three scores is 5.0, scaled to the 0–10 range yields 10.
Alignment: Base alignment: responsibilities ~75% (matches architecting distributed systems, scalable cloud services, microservices; partial for leadership/mentoring and team-level agile influence), tools/technologies ~70% (strong AWS, Python, Docker, CI/CD, databases including Oracle DB listed, but no Java nor explicit Oracle Cloud experience, IDEs not shown), outcomes ~90% (multiple quantified results: 1M+ records pipeline, 5× faster feedback loops, +5% accuracy / -8% toxicity, 60% time reduction, 300% application increase). Weighted score converts to ~8/10. Specificity penalty: resume is generic and not tailored to Oracle/Senior title (minus 2). Concrete-evidence bonus: named tools and quantified metrics present (+1). Final score reflects matched: Python, AWS (EC2/S3/Lambda/Glue/SageMaker/Bedrock), microservices, Docker, CI/CD, measurable outcomes; partially matched: leadership/mentoring, multi-tenant/operational-excellence emphasis; missing or weak: explicit Oracle Cloud/OCI experience, Java, IDE mentions, clear Senior-level engineering ownership. Penalty applied for lack of company/title tailoring.
Impact: The resume contains multiple action verbs with explicit, measurable results and clear business impact — e.g., “Automated a sentiment-analysis pipeline processing 1M+ records” with “5× faster feedback loops,” “fine-tuned models… improving accuracy by ~5% and reducing toxicity by ~8%,” “reduced time to apply by 60% and boosted weekly applications by 300%,” plus 96% cohort graduation rate and 800+ refurbished devices. Language is predominantly active and shows scalability and context across projects. A few bullets lack numeric specificity (e.g., reference architectures) but this is minor given the strong, repeated quantification throughout.
CredTail: Following the evaluation steps, the Actual Output is fully supported by the Retrieval Context across Education, Experience, and Core Skills.

Experience: Solutions Architect Intern at Amazon Web Services (Arlington, VA; Jun 2025–Sep 2025) with Bedrock/Glue/Athena/Lambda/SageMaker highlights, Software Developer Intern at WOPLLI (Jun 2024–Sep 2024), IT Support Intern (Mayor’s Office of Information Services, Feb 2024–May 2024), and IT Instructor Assistant (Feb 2022–Aug 2023) all match dates, employers, locations, and bullet highlights in the Retrieval Context. Core Skills: detailed technology list (Python libraries, AWS services including Bedrock and SageMaker, Azure services, FastAPI, PostgreSQL+pgvector, Docker, CI/CD, etc.) aligns with the structured core_skills and project tech entries. No contradictions, missing critical fields (degrees, employers, or dates), or clear fabrications were found in the Retrieval Context, so no penalties applied.

Tone: Professionalism 5/5 — clear, consistent headings and bullets, good grammar and formatting across sections. Action-Oriented 5/5 — many strong action verbs and measurable impacts (e.g., 1M+ records, 5× faster feedback loops, ~5% accuracy gain, ~8% toxicity reduction, 60% time savings, 300% application increase). Persona Alignment 5/5 — role-specific vocabulary and tools (AWS services including Bedrock/SageMaker, Athena/Glue/Lambda, CI/CD, FastAPI, embeddings) closely match a Solutions Architect/Data Science persona. Average = 5.0; max-min difference = 0 (no inconsistency). Minor nitpick: competencies list is dense and contains a small label inconsistency ('Postgre'), but overall the resume strongly meets the evaluation criteria.
Alignment: Checklist extracted expected RN responsibilities (patient assessment, medication/IV administration, wound/rehab care, documentation, interdisciplinary collaboration, night-shift availability) and clinical tools/outcomes (EMR use, patient recovery/therapy metrics, satisfaction/readmission reduction). The resume is entirely technology-focused (AWS, Python, ML, data pipelines, GitHub) with no nursing duties, clinical tools, measurable patient outcomes, or any Encompass Health/Registered Nurse customization—so responsibilities, tools, and outcomes are Missing. The submission is generic and misaligned with the RN role, warranting a very low alignment score.
Impact: High presence of explicit quantitative results (multiple metrics: 1M+ records processed with 5× faster feedback loops; model improvements ~+5% accuracy and ~-8% toxicity; Alfred project: -60% time-to-apply and +300% weekly applications; 96% cohort graduation rate, 800+ devices refurbished) satisfies the requirement for ≥2 quantified outcomes. The language is strongly action-oriented with many active verbs (designed, built, automated, fine-tuned, implemented, integrated), giving clear agency. Business linkage is generally present—efficiency and throughput improvements, increased applicant volume, operational scale—but some metrics lack clear baselines or explicit timeframes and a few impact statements aren’t tied directly to revenue or cost-savings (e.g., “designed and presented” architectures without measured outcome). Weighted against the evaluation steps (metrics 50%, action language 30%, business impact 20%) and applying a minor penalty for occasional missing baselines/context, the output aligns strongly with the criteria.

Tone: The resume demonstrates high professionalism (clear header with LinkedIn/GitHub, concise summary, organized sections for competencies, experience, projects, education, and certifications). It is action-oriented with strong verbs and measurable outcomes (e.g., “Automated a sentiment-analysis pipeline processing 1M+ records,” “5× faster feedback loops,” “fine-tuned models improving accuracy ~5% and reducing toxicity ~8%,” “reduced time to apply by 60% and boosted applications by 300%”). Persona alignment is excellent: AWS/SageMaker/Bedrock, generative AI projects (Alfred), and roles (Solutions Architect Intern at AWS) consistently support the stated solutions-focused technologist identity. There is no notable imbalance between criteria; action-oriented details and persona evidence logically reinforce the professional presentation.
Alignment: Responsibilities: Partially matched — resume shows Linux experience (Linux listed in competencies; Linux teaching and IT support) but does not demonstrate Subject Matter Expert role in Linux-based system development or embedded engineering. Tools/Technologies: Partially matched — Linux and Docker present, many named cloud/AI tools (AWS services, SageMaker, Bedrock, QuickSight) but key required technologies C++ and .NET and embedded toolchains are absent. Outcomes/Metrics: Partially matched — strong, concrete quantified results (1M+ records processed, 5× faster pipelines, ~5% accuracy improvement, 8% toxicity reduction, 60% time reduction, 300% application increase) but these are cloud/ML-focused rather than embedded/Linux system outcomes. Scoring: base weighted match ~50% → 5/10; applied -2 for lack of tailoring to a Sr. Software Engineer/embedded role; added +1 for multiple concrete, named tools and quantified results. Final assessment: matched—Linux exposure and strong cloud/AI metrics; partially matched—general software development outcomes; missing—C++, .NET, embedded engineering experience and explicit SME/role/company tailoring.
Impact: The output contains multiple action-oriented bullets with clear, measurable results and business impact (e.g., automated sentiment pipeline processing 1M+ records with 5× faster feedback loops; SageMaker fine-tuning improving accuracy ~5% and reducing toxicity ~8%; Alfred project reducing time-to-apply 60% and boosting weekly applications 300%; 96% cohort graduation rate; refurbished 800+ devices, 100+ VIP support tickets). Those examples satisfy Step 1 and place the profile in the 7–9 band for explicit metrics plus demonstrable impact. Shortcomings: several items remain high-level or lack numeric specificity (e.g., “designed and presented AWS reference architectures,” “built POCs combining Bedrock LLMs” without outcome metrics), and a few bullets use generic/qualifier language, so a small penalty was applied for missing specificity and some passive phrasing. Overall the output shows strong quantified impact but is not uniformly metric-driven across all entries.
CredTail: All major claims are directly supported by the Retrieval Context. Education: both degrees (M.S. Data Science & Machine Learning at CUNY SPS, expected Jan 2026, GPA 4.0; B.Tech Computer Information Systems at CUNY NYC College of Technology, Jun 2024, GPA 3.78) match the context.

Core Skills: the detailed list (Python libs, SQL/NoSQL, AWS services including Bedrock/SageMaker/Glue/QuickSight, Azure, FastAPI, PostgreSQL+pgvector, Docker, CI/CD, ML items) aligns with the Retrieval Context (minor spelling/formatting differences such as “Clusering Algorithms” or “Postgre” do not change semantic match). No clear fabricated items were found in the required fields (degrees, institutions, employers, dates, core technologies). Only minor artifacts-level inconsistencies exist (an alternate phone number appears in the artifacts portion), but these do not affect the evaluated categories. Based on full support across Education, Experience, and Core Skills and no penalties for fabrication or missing critical fields, the final credibility score reflects complete alignment.",302,2025-12-19 05:57:30.889953,8,10

There is no significant imbalance between criteria, and the action-oriented examples and persona evidence consistently support the professional presentation. The average on the 1–5 rubric is at the maximum and was mapped to the requested 0–10 output.
Alignment: Using the 50/30/20 weighting: Responsibilities partially matched (Linux experience and Linux teaching/support present but no clear SME role or embedded systems work) → ~40% match; Tools/Technologies largely absent (no C++ or .NET, only tangential Linux mention and other unrelated stacks) → ~20% match; Outcomes/metrics strongly matched (multiple quantified results and named tools such as AWS, SageMaker, Docker, 1M+ records, 5×, 60%/300% improvements) → ~90% match. Weighted sum ≈44% → base ≈4/10. Applied specificity penalty (-2) because the resume is generic and does not reference Robert Half, the Sr. title, or Brooklyn tailoring. Added small concrete-evidence bonus (+2) for named tools and measurable results. Final score reflects matched items (Linux, quantified outcomes, cloud/AWS), partially matched responsibilities (Linux but not SME/embedded), missing items (embedded engineering, C++, .NET, explicit company/title tailoring) and the penalty for lack of tailoring.
Impact: The output contains multiple strong, measurable action statements (e.g., automated pipeline processing 1M+ records, 5× faster feedback loops; fine-tuned models improving accuracy ~5% and reducing toxicity ~8%; reduced time-to-apply by 60% and increased weekly applications by 300%; refurbished 800+ devices; 96% cohort graduation rate), showing clear action verbs plus explicit metrics and business-relevant outcomes. Shortcomings: several bullets remain unquantified or high-level (e.g., cloud configuration, architecture design) and some phrasing is somewhat generic/passive, which reduces overall clarity on ROI and scalability. Given the clear, repeated quantification but occasional missing specificity and some passive language, the score reflects strong but not exceptional alignment with the evaluative criteria.

Action-Oriented: strong, measurable accomplishments (e.g., automated pipeline processing 1M+ records, 5× faster feedback loops, 60% time reduction for applications, weekly applications up 300%) and active verbs describing outcomes. Persona Alignment: consistently portrays a solutions-focused technologist with appropriate skills and projects (AWS — Bedrock, SageMaker, Glue; Alfred project using FastAPI, GPT-4 mini, pgvector). There is no significant imbalance and the Action-Oriented and Persona Alignment support the Professionalism assessment, so the computed average per the evaluation steps yields the highest possible rating.
Alignment: Evaluation per the steps: Responsibilities — explicit match: resume shows Python, microservices/modern architectures, scalable AWS designs, FastAPI and system design experience and includes performance optimization work. Tools/Technologies — explicit match: names many required tools (Python, PyTorch/scikit-learn, AWS services including Bedrock and SageMaker, PostgreSQL + pgvector, Docker, FastAPI, DynamoDB, etc.). Outcomes/Metrics — explicit match: concrete quantified results (1M+ record pipeline, 5× faster feedback loops, model accuracy/toxicity deltas, 60% time reduction and 300% increase on a project). Partially matched / missing: no explicit tailoring to the company/title (Robert Half / “Senior” role) and limited explicit senior-level leadership/management language. Adjustment: applied a penalty for lack of company/title tailoring and a positive adjustment for strong named tools and multiple quantified outcomes. Overall strong alignment with responsibilities, tools, and measurable outcomes, with the primary shortcoming being absence of explicit company/title tailoring and senior-role signals.
Impact: The resume repeatedly pairs action verbs with clear, measurable outcomes (e.g., automated a sentiment pipeline processing 1M+ records with 5× faster feedback loops; fine‑tuned SageMaker models improving accuracy ~5% and reducing toxicity ~8%; Alfred cut time‑to‑apply by 60% and increased weekly applications by 300%; maintained a 96% cohort graduation rate; refurbished 800+ devices). These demonstrate explicit business impact and scalability.

Scores are balanced and consistent, so the average is 5.0.
Alignment: Strong alignment with the job requirements: Responsibilities explicitly matched (designing scalable Python systems, microservices/OOP, FastAPI, ETL pipelines, CI/CD). Tools/technologies explicitly matched (Python ecosystem, AWS services including SageMaker/Bedrock, PostgreSQL+pgvector, Docker, GitHub Actions, PyTorch/scikit-learn). Outcomes/metrics largely present (1M+ record pipeline, 5× faster feedback loops, ~5% accuracy improvement, −8% toxicity, 60% time reduction, 300% application increase) — so outcomes are present though some low-level production performance optimization details are not deeply described. Specific shortcoming: the resume is generic and not tailored to Robert Half or the Sr. Software Engineer title (penalty applied). Matched: responsibilities, major tools, multiple quantified results. Partially matched: some production-performance engineering detail. Missing: explicit company/title tailoring and a few production-scale performance optimization specifics.
Impact: Strong use of action verbs plus multiple explicit, measurable results and business outcomes (e.g., automated sentiment pipeline processing 1M+ records with 5× faster feedback loops; fine‑tuned SageMaker models improving accuracy ~5% and reducing toxicity ~8%; Alfred project cutting application time 60% and increasing weekly applications 300%; 96% cohort graduation; refurbished 800+ devices).

Tone: The resume is highly professional: clear sections, consistent formatting, and no grammar issues. It is strongly action-oriented with numerous active verbs and measurable outcomes (e.g., automated pipeline processing 1M+ records, 5× faster feedback loops, ~5% accuracy improvement and ~8% toxicity reduction, 60% faster applications and 300% more weekly applications). Persona alignment is excellent for cloud/data/AI roles—extensive AWS and ML tooling (Bedrock, SageMaker, Glue, Athena), relevant projects (Alfred agentic assistant), and appropriate seniority for solutions architect/data-science positions. The three criterion scores are consistent, producing a top combined rating based on the provided evaluation steps.
Alignment: Checklist created from the JD included responsibilities (1–9), minimum quals (10–13), and preferred quals (14–21). Strengths: the resume explicitly documents AWS architecture work, microservices, APIs/FastAPI, CI/CD, databases (Postgres/pgvector, DynamoDB), Python-based ML/LLM work (Bedrock, SageMaker), and concrete outcomes (automated pipeline processing 1M+ records, 5× faster feedback loops; fine-tuning improving accuracy ~5% and reducing toxicity ~8%; Alfred project reducing time-to-apply 60% and increasing applications 300%). Those map to items like architecting scalable systems, building reusable back-end components, performance optimization, variety of technologies, and ownership of projects. Partial matches: cross-functional collaboration and system ownership are shown (vendor relations, presentations, project ownership) but mostly from internships/projects rather than sustained team leadership; maintainable/testable code and release practices are referenced (testing scripts, GitHub Actions) but not detailed as large-scale production engineering practices. Missing or weak: the critical minimum qualification of 6+ years programming experience (or equivalent senior track record) is not met; front-end/UI implementation (modern client-side frameworks or mobile UI work) and key preferred languages (C/C++, Java, Swift, Kotlin) are not present; evidence of setting long-term technical direction for a team and sustained high-reliability production ownership is limited. Penalizations: major omission for senior level experience and some company/title-specific responsibilities (lead technical efforts, long-term product ownership) reduces fit despite strong technical tool coverage and quant metrics. Given the mix of many explicit/partial matches on tools and measurable outcomes but a major mismatch on seniority and front-end/mobile language experience, the resume scores low-to-mid for this Meta Product Software Engineer role.
Impact: The resume contains multiple bullets with clear action verbs plus numeric metrics and business outcomes: e.g., automated a sentiment pipeline processing 1M+ records with real-time QuickSight dashboards and “5× faster feedback loops”; fine-tuned SageMaker models improving accuracy (~5%) and reducing toxicity (~8%); Alfred project reduced time-to-apply by 60% and increased weekly applications by 300%; 96% cohort graduation rate and 800+ devices refurbished are additional measurable results. These demonstrate explicit actions, numeric metrics, and business impact. Minor shortcomings: several bullets are descriptive or lack metrics (e.g., “designed and presented… reference architectures,” “built POCs” without outcome), and a few use passive or non-quantified phrasing, which justifies a small penalty from a perfect score.
CredTail: Nearly all claims in the Actual Output are directly supported by the Retrieval Context: name, contact info, summary, employers (AWS, WOPLLI, Mayor’s Office, RF CUNY & Generation USA), internship dates (Jun 2025–Sep 2025; Jun 2024–Sep 2024; Feb 2024–May 2024; Feb 2022–Aug 2023), degrees (MS expected Jan 2026 with GPA 4.0; BTech Jun 2024 with GPA 3.78 and honors), certifications, project “Alfred” and its tech (FastAPI, PostgreSQL+pgvector, OpenAI GPT-4.1 mini, Docker, CI/CD), and the listed core technologies and skills (Python libraries, AWS services including Bedrock and SageMaker, Glue, QuickSight, Azure items, databases, ML topics). No major fabrications were found. Only minor discrepancies are present (spelling/typographical differences in the Retrieval Context such as “Clusering Algorithms” vs the Actual Output’s “Clustering Algorithms” and “Refeerbished” vs “Refurbished”), which warrant partial support for those specific tokens but do not change the factual alignment of the claims. Those small mismatches led to a one-point deduction from a perfect match.",327,2025-12-19 07:06:50.249999,9,9
265,1068,P0,10,10,4,43,"Punctuality: The score is 1.00 because the contradictions list is empty, indicating no discrepancies between the actual output and the retrieval context; well done.
Tone: Professionalism: high—clean formatting, formal tone, clear contact/header and structured sections (Summary, Core Competencies, Experience, Projects, Education, Certifications). Action-Oriented: strong—uses active verbs and measurable outcomes throughout (e.g., “Automated a sentiment-analysis pipeline processing 1M+ records,” “5× faster feedback loops,” accuracy +5%, toxicity −8%, Alfred: −60% time, +300% applications). Persona Alignment: excellent—skills and project work map tightly to the target solutions-architect/data-science/ML persona (AWS services: Bedrock, SageMaker, Glue, QuickSight; LLMs, RAG, FastAPI, pgvector). Minor nitpicks (small wording inconsistency like “Postgre” vs PostgreSQL and a very broad competency list vs internship-level seniority) do not materially reduce suitability. Overall average of the three criteria is at the top of the scale.
Alignment: Followed the checklist from the job posting: resume explicitly matches core programming/data skills (Python, SQL/relational DBs, AWS services like EC2/S3/Lambda/Glue/SageMaker, Git, Docker, CI/CD) and shows measurable outcomes (1M+ record pipeline, 5× faster feedback loops, model accuracy +5%/toxicity -8%, 60% time reduction/300% applications). Several responsibilities/tools are only partial matches (microservices, scalable architectures, Linux instruction, internships covering scripting) but lack explicit systems-level experience required by Meta (OS-level software, compilers, network distribution, building high‑volume servers at platform scale), core web technologies (HTML/CSS/JavaScript), editor experience (VIM/Emacs), and explicit test-coverage or company/product-release practices. Given roughly half the checklist is explicit/partial and several major systems-level omissions plus some generic phrasing, the resume is moderately aligned but missing key Meta systems engineering requirements.
Impact: Most bullets include explicit actions plus clear numeric metrics and business outcomes (e.g., automated sentiment pipeline processing 1M+ records with 5× faster feedback loops; SageMaker fine-tuning improving accuracy ~5% and reducing toxicity ~8%; Alfred project reducing time-to-apply by 60% and increasing weekly applications by 300%; 96% cohort graduation rate; refurbished 800+ devices; surfaced >100 white-glove tickets). These demonstrate strong measurable impact consistent with the 9–10 category. Minor deductions applied because several experience lines remain vague or lack metrics (e.g., “Built POCs,” “Designed architectures,” “Configured Azure,” “Produced diagrams”), and a few bullets use general phrasing without explicit business impact — so I reduced a perfect score accordingly.
CredTail: All major claims in the Actual Output (personal info, summary, core competencies, employers and dates, project tech, education, and certifications) directly match entries in the Retrieval Context. Examples: Solutions Architect Intern at Amazon Web Services (Arlington, VA) Jun 2025–Sep 2025 and Software Developer Intern at WOPLLI Jun 2024–Sep 2024 are present with identical highlights; the Alfred project (FastAPI, PostgreSQL+pgvector, OpenAI GPT-4.1 mini), MS expected Jan 2026 and BS Jun 2024, and listed AWS services (Bedrock, SageMaker, Glue, QuickSight, etc.) all appear in the context. No claims in the Actual Output are missing or contradicted in the Retrieval Context (only minor typographical errors exist in the source data), so no fabrications or penalties were applied.",332,2025-12-19 07:10:24.63492,9,10
