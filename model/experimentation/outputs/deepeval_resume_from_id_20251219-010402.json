    "variant": "P3",
    "punctuality_score": 0.8888888888888888,
    "punctuality_reason": "The score is 0.89 because the actual output incorrectly lists the Mayor's Office IT Support Intern as 'Feb 2024 \u2013 Current' while the retrieval context clearly shows the position ran Feb 2024\u2013May 2024; the described duties (providing white\u2011glove service, collaboration, and use of tools) are supported by the profile, but the timeline is wrong.",
    "tone_score": 0.7,
    "tone_reason": "Professionalism is strong \u2014 the document is well-formatted, formal in tone, and grammatically clean with clear sections and contact info. Action-oriented elements are good \u2014 uses action verbs and includes quantified achievements (e.g., 36 lessons, 200+ learners, 96% graduation rate), though some volunteer bullets lack explicit outcome/impact phrasing. Persona alignment is weak for the stated nursing target: the summary\u2019s patient-centered language is undermined by predominantly tech-focused education, IT experience, and no clinical qualifications, creating a notable mismatch that meets the flagged threshold. Overall: polished and impact-oriented for IT/education roles but insufficiently aligned to a nursing role.",
    "alignment_score": 0.1,
    "alignment_reason": "Job requires a Registered Nurse for Encompass Health Rehabilitation Hospital of Treasure Coast (full-time 7P-7A, clinical inpatient/rehab care). Expected items: RN license/credentials, clinical skills (medication administration, vital signs, wound care, rehab therapies), BLS/ACLS, inpatient/rehab experience, shift availability, and interdisciplinary patient-care outcomes. The Actual Output is technology-focused (MS Data Science in progress, IT Instructor Assistant, IT Support intern, AWS/Google certs) with no RN license, no clinical experience or nursing certifications, and no mention of medication administration, wound care, BLS/ACLS, or shift availability \u2014 these are absent. Partial matches: patient-centered language in the summary, bilingual Spanish, and teamwork/communication skills are present but not clinical. The resume only lightly references Encompass Health in a generic sentence and lacks tailoring to the specific rehab RN role. Given mostly absent critical nursing qualifications and additional penalty for generic/company-light tailoring, the alignment is very low.",
    "impact_score": 0.6,
    "impact_reason": "Two strong bullets include measurable metrics (36 lessons to 200+ learners; 96% cohort graduation rate), but only the graduation-rate bullet clearly contains all three required elements (accomplishment, metric, explicit business outcome). Four other bullets lack quantifiable metrics and explicit business outcomes (e.g., \u201cdeveloped testing materials\u201d; \u201cprovide white glove service\u201d; \u201ccollaborate\u2026restore and maintain\u201d; \u201cutilize various tools\u201d), and several use vague/replaceable phrasing that triggers the passive/vague penalty. Following the evaluation steps (count of fully-specified bullets = 1, multiple missing metric/outcome elements across bullets with proportional penalties, plus language penalties), the overall alignment is moderate but limited by the numerous unspecified results and weak wording.",
    "credtail_score": 0.4,
    "credtail_reason": "Verified: both degrees (M.S. Data Science & ML expected Jan 2026; B.Tech CIS Jun 2024) and contact info (email, phone, location, LinkedIn) match the Retrieval Context; IT Instructor Assistant role and dates (Feb 2022\u2013Aug 2023) match; listed certifications (AWS Solutions Architect, Google Cybersecurity, Google Information Support) are present. Missing/conflicting: Mayor\u2019s Office role appears in Retrieval as \u201cIT Support Intern\u201d dated Feb 2024\u2013May 2024 but Actual Output lists \u201cVolunteer IT Support and Development Intern\u201d Feb 2024\u2013Current (date/status and title conflict) \u2014 treated as a factual conflict; two high-weight employers in the Retrieval (AWS Solutions Architect Intern Jun\u2013Sep 2025 and Software Developer Intern at WOPLLI Jun\u2013Sep 2024) are omitted in the Actual Output (significant omission). Major omissions: the Retrieval\u2019s comprehensive technical core-skills (Python, AWS services, SQL/NoSQL, ML/ETL/LLM tooling, etc.) are largely absent from the Actual Output\u2019s short, non-technical Core Skills. Summary mismatch: Retrieval describes a technologist/AI focus while Actual\u2019s summary targets a nursing role (inconsistent with evidence). Given full agreement on degrees and some roles but conflicts on employment dates/status, omission of a major AWS internship, and absence of core technologies, I apply substantial deductions and assign a below-midline credibility score."
