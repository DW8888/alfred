Discrepancies / penalties applied: - Missing: Google Information Support Certificate \u2014 minor omission (deduct 1 point). - Partial omissions: omission of campus qualifier for MS and college phrasing for B.Tech (minor; no further deduction beyond overall rounding). - Fabricated/Unverified claims in Actual Output: Java and Tableau appear in Core Skills but are not present in the Retrieval Context (each treated as small fabrications; deduct 1 point each).
