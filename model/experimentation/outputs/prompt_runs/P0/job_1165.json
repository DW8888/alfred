  "reasoning": "Darwhin Gomez is a strong match for the Software Engineer, Android position at Capital One. His experience includes a solid foundation in software development, particularly with Python, which is relevant for Android development. Although he does not explicitly mention Android development experience, his background in software engineering principles, Agile methodologies, and CI/CD practices aligns well with the collaborative and iterative environment described in the job description. Furthermore, his internship at Amazon Web Services involved designing scalable architectures and automating data pipelines, showcasing his ability to solve complex problems, which is a key requirement for the role. His academic background in Computer Information Systems and ongoing Master\u2019s in Data Science and Machine Learning further supports his technical capabilities. However, specific experience with Android development technologies (e.g., Java/Kotlin for Android) is not mentioned, which is a potential gap for this role. Overall, Darwhin's skills and experiences make him a competitive candidate for the position, but he may need to highlight any relevant mobile development experience more explicitly if available.",
