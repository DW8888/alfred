Missing: no Snowflake mention and the mandatory domain experience (asset management, alternatives investments, financial services) is absent. Specificity/relevance: resume uses cloud/data-architecture language but does not reference the Data Engineer title, Cloud BC Labs, or senior/lead data engineering responsibilities\u2014roles are intern/early-career and off-target for a Lead Data Engineer/Architect hire. Outcomes/metrics: there are quantifiable results, but they are not tied to the required financial domain or enterprise asset-management outcomes. Overall assessment: meaningful technical overlaps (AWS Glue, SQL, Python, data modeling, ETL) are outweighed by missing mandatory domain expertise, Snowflake, and seniority/role-specific alignment, so the resume only partially fits the job requirements.",

However several bullets are vague or lack metrics (e.g., \u201cDesigned and presented secure, scalable AWS architectures,\u201d WOPLLI items, and some automation/support lines), which warrants a small deduction for missing quantification and occasional non-actionable phrasing.
