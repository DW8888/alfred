  "reasoning": "The experience and skills listed in the structured profile align with the job description for the Software Engineer, Android position at Meta. The core skills include programming languages and methodologies relevant to software development, such as Python and Agile/Scrum, which are applicable to the role. However, there is no direct mention of Android development or Java experience, which are critical for the position. The experience as a Software Developer Intern at WOPLLI Technologies includes relevant tasks such as API integration and application development, but lacks specific Android application development experience. Therefore, the resume will focus on the supported experiences and skills while omitting unsupported claims related to Android development.",
